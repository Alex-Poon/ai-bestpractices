## Summary

Anthropic announced Claude Opus 4.6, their most advanced model to date, featuring a landmark 1 million token context window in beta -- the first for an Opus-class model. The release emphasizes substantial improvements in agentic coding, long-context work, and sustained multi-step workflows.

On benchmarks, Opus 4.6 achieved the top score on Terminal-Bench 2.0 for agentic coding and led on Humanity's Last Exam for complex reasoning. On GDPval-AA, which measures economically valuable work tasks, it outperformed the industry's next-best model by a significant margin. Long-context retrieval accuracy hit 76% on needle-in-haystack tests compared to much lower scores from competitors.

The release coincided with Claude Code version 2.1.32, which introduced several notable features: a research preview of agent teams for multi-agent collaboration, automatic memory recording and recall during work sessions, and a "Summarize from here" message selector feature. The agent teams feature requires an experimental flag and is described as token-intensive.

Anthropic also offered promotional credits to encourage testing the new model. The release came less than 35 minutes before OpenAI announced GPT-5.3 Codex, creating a memorable moment of simultaneous frontier model launches.

Beyond coding, the model handles financial analysis, research, and document work. Safety evaluations show it maintains or exceeds standards of prior frontier models with low rates of misaligned behavior.

## Key Insights

- **1M context is the real headline**: While benchmarks impress, the Opus-class 1M token context window opens new use cases for working with entire codebases
- **Agent teams go native**: Multi-agent collaboration is now built into Claude Code, reducing friction compared to third-party coordination tools
- **Competitive pressure accelerates releases**: The near-simultaneous launch with GPT-5.3 Codex highlights the pace of frontier model competition

## HN Discussion Highlights

*629 comments total*

**ck_one**: Just tested the new Opus 4.6 (1M context) on a fun needle-in-a-haystack challenge: finding every spell in all Harry Potter books. All 7 books come to ~1.75M tokens, so they don't quite fit yet. (At...

>> **vercaemert**: It's impressive, even if the books and the posts you're talking about were both key parts of the training data. There are many academic domains where the research portion of a PhD is essentially what...

>>> **adastra22**: I don’t think this example proves your point. There’s no indication that the model actually worked this out from the input context, instead of regurgitating it from the training weights. A better...

>> **MarcellusDrum**: So a good test would be replacing the spell names in the books with made-up spells. And if a "real" spell name was given, it also tests whether it "cheated".

>>> **lxgr**: It could still remember where each spell is mentioned. I think the only way to properly test this would be to run it against an unpublished manuscript.

>>> **outofpaper**: A real test is synthesizing 100,000 sentences of this slect random ones and then inject the traits you want thr LLM to detect and describe, eg have a set of words or phrases that may represent spells...

>> **anomaly_**: Sounds pretty human like! Always searching for a shortcut

>>> **lpcvoid**: It sounds like it's lying and making stuff up, something everybody seems to be okay with when using LLMs.

>> **nobodywillobsrv**: Yes I have found that grok for example actually suddenly becomes quite sane when you tell it to stop querying the internet And just rethink the conversation data and answer the question. It's weird,...

>>> **Szpadel**: but isn't it what we wanted? we complained so much that LLM uses deprecated or outdated apis instead of current version because they relied so much on what they remembered

>>> **bestham**: Touché, that is what we humans are doing to some degree as well.

> **xiomrze**: Honest question, how do you know if it's pulling from context vs from memory? If I use Opus 4.6 with Extended Thinking (Web Search disabled, no books attached), it answers with 130 spells.

>> **ozim**: Exactly there was this study where they were trying to make LLM reproduce HP book word for word like giving first sentences and letting it cook. Basically they managed with some tricks make 99% word...

>>> **pron**: This reminds me of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Menard,_Author_of_the_Q... : > Borges's "review" describes Menard's efforts to go beyond a mere "translation" of Don Quixote by immersing...

>>> **ck_one**: Do you remember how to get around those tricks?

>> **petercooper**: One possible trick could be to search and replace them all with nonsense alternatives then see if it extracts those.

>>> **andai**: That might actually boost performance since attention pays attention to stuff that stands out. If I make a typo, the models often hyperfixate on it.

>>> **jazzyjackson**: A fine instruction following task but if harry potter is in the weights of the neural net, it's going to mix some of the real ones with the alternates.

>> **ck_one**: When I tried it without web search so only internal knowledge it missed ~15 spells.

>> **clanker_fluffer**: What was your prompt?

> **matt_lo**: use AI to rewrite all the spells from all the books, then try to see if AI can detect the rewritten ones. This will ensure it's not pulling from it's trained data set.

>> **gbalduzzi**: Neat idea, but why should I use AI for a find and replace? It feels like shooting a fly with a bazooka

>>> **jack_pp**: it's like hiring someone to come pick up your trash from your house and put it on the curb. it's fine if you're disabled

>>> **miohtama**: Bazooka guarantees the hit

>>> **imafish**: If all you have is a hammer.. ;)

>>> **bilekas**: You're missing the point, it's only a testing excersize for the new model.

>>> **luckydata**: do you know all the spells you're looking for from memory?

>> **LeoPanthera**: That won't help. The AI replacing them will probably miss the same ones as the AI finding them.

>>> **steve1977**: I think the question was if it will still find 49 out of 50 if they have been replaced.

> **golfer**: There's lots of websites that list the spells. It's well documented. Could Claude simply be regurgitating knowledge from the web? Example: https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_spells

>> **qwertytyyuu**: Hmm… maybe he could switch out all the spells names slightly different ones and see how that goes

>> **ck_one**: It didn't use web search. But for sure it has some internal knowledge already. It's not a perfect needle in the hay stack problem but gemini flash was much worse when I tested it last time.

>>> **viraptor**: If you want to really test this, search/replace the names with your own random ones and see if it lists those. Otherwise, LLMs have most of the books memorised anyway:...

>>> **joshmlewis**: I think the OP was implying that it's probably already baked into its training data. No need to search the web for that.

>>> **obirunda**: This underestimates how much of the Internet is actually compressed into and is an integral part of the model's weights. Gemini 2.5 can recite the first Harry Potter book verbatim for over 75% of the...

>>> **altmanaltman**: > But for sure it has some internal knowledge already. Pretty sure the books had to be included in its training material in full text. It's one of the most popular book series ever created, of course...

>>> **Trasmatta**: Do the same experiment in the Claude web UI. And explicitly turn web searches off. It got almost all of them for me over a couple of prompts. That stuff is already in its training data.

>>> **soulofmischief**: The only worthwhile version of this test involves previously unseen data that could not have been in the training set. Otherwise the results could be inaccurate to the point of harmful.

>>> **IAmGraydon**: I'm not sure what your knowledge level of the inner workings of LLMs is, but a model doesn't need search or even an internet connection to "know" the information if it's in its training dataset. In...

>>> **eek2121**: Honestly? My advice would be to cook something custom up! You don't need to do all the text yourself. Maybe have AI spew out a bunch of text, or take obscure existing text and insert hidden phrases...

> **meroes**: What is this supposed to show exactly? Those books have been feed into LLMs for years and there's even likely specific RLHF's on extracting spells from HP.

>> **muzani**: There was a time when I put the EA-Nasir text into base64 and asked AI to convert it. Remarkably it identified the correct text but pulled the most popular translation of the text than the one I gave...

>>> **majewsky**: Sucks that you got a really shitty response to your prompt. If I were you, the model provider would be receiving my complaint via clay tablet right away.

>> **rvz**: > What is this supposed to show exactly? Nothing. You can be sure that this was already known in the training data of PDFs, books and websites that Anthropic scraped to train Claude on; hence...

> **hansmayer**: > Just tested the new Opus 4.6 (1M context) on a fun needle-in-a-haystack challenge: finding every spell in all Harry Potter books. Clearly a very useful, grounded and helpful everyday use case of...

> **zamadatix**: To be fair, I don't think "Slugulus Eructo" (the name) is actually in the books. This is what's in my copy: > The smug look on Malfoy’s face flickered. > “No one asked your opinion, you filthy little...

>> **sobjornstad**: I have a vague recollection that it might come up named as such in Half-Blood Prince, written in Snape's old potions textbook? In support of that hypothesis, the Fandom site lists it as “mentioned”...

>>> **zamadatix**: Hmm, I don't get a hit for "slugulus" or "eructo" (case insensitive) in any of the 7. Interestingly two mentions of "vomit" are in book 6, but neither in reference to to slugs (plenty of Slughorn of...

>> **ck_one**: Then it's fair that id didn't find it

> **muzani**: There's a benchmark which works similarly but they ask harder questions, also based on books https://fiction.live/stories/Fiction-liveBench-Feb-21-2025/o... I guess they have to add more questions as...

> **kybernetikos**: I recently got junie to code me up an MCP for accessing my calibre library. https://www.npmjs.com/package/access-calibre My standard test for that was "Who ends up with Bilbo's buttons?"

> **dwa3592**: have another LLM (gemini, chatgpt) make up 50 new spells. insert those and test and maybe report here :)

> **dom96**: I often wonder how much of the Harry Potter books were used in the training. How long before some LLM is able to regurgitate full HP books without access to the internet?

> **bartman**: Have you by any chance tried this with GPT 4.1 too (also 1M context)?

> **siwatanejo**: > All 7 books come to ~1.75M tokens How do you know? Each word is one token?

>> **koakuma-chan**: You can download the books and run them through a tokenizer. I did that half a year ago and got ~2M.

> **LanceJones**: Assuming this experiment involved isolating the LLM from its training set?

> **irishcoffee**: The top comment is about finding basterized latin words from childrens books. The future is here.

>> **Geste**: I'll have some of that coffee too, this is quite a sad time we're living where this is a proper use of our limited resources.

>> **mhink**: > basterized And yet, it's still somewhat better than the Hacker News comment using bastardized English words.

> **guluarte**: you can get the same result just asking opus/gpt, it is probably internalized knowledge from reddit or similar sites.

>> **ck_one**: If you just ask it you don't get the same result. Around 13 spells were missing when I just prompted Opus 4.6 without the books as context.

>>> **guluarte**: because it is non-deterministic, i just did and got 50 spells. prompt:  finding every spell in all Harry Potter books in the first 4 books, only the officially documented spells across those 4 books,...

> **TheRealPomax**: That doesn't seem a super useful test for a model that's optimized for programming?

> **dr_dshiv**: Comparison to another model?

> **huangmeng**: you are rich

> **IhateAI**: like I often say, these tools are mostly useful for people to do magic tricks on themselves (and to convince C-suites that they can lower pay, and reduce staff if they pay Anthropic half their...

> **dudewhocodes**: There are websites with the spells listed... which makes this a search problem. Why is an LLM used here?

>> **bilekas**: It's just a benchmark test excersize.

**gizmodo59**: 5.3 codex https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-3-codex/ crushes with a 77.3% in Terminal Bench. The shortest lived lead in less than 35 minutes. What a time to be alive!

> **wasmainiac**: Dumb question. Can these benchmarks be trusted when the model performance tends to vary depending on the hours and load on OpenAI’s servers? How do I know I’m not getting a severe penalty for...

>> **tedsanders**: We don't vary our model quality with time of day or load (beyond negligible non-determinism). It's the same weights all day long with no quantization or other gimmicks. They can get slower under...

>>> **wasmainiac**: Thanks for the response, I appreciate it. I do notice variation in quality throughout the day. I use it primarily for searching documentation since it’s faster than google in most case, often it is...

>>> **GorbachevyChase**: Hi Ted. I think that language models are great, and they’ve enabled me to do passion projects I never would have attempted before. I just want to say thanks.

>>> **zamadatix**: I appreciate you taking the time to respond to these kinds of questions the last few days.

>>> **robertclaus**: Hi Ted! Small world to see you here!

>>> **Trufa**: Can you be more specific than this? does it vary in time from launch of a model to the next few months, beyond tinkering and optimization?

>>> **Someone1234**: Specifically including routing (i.e. which model you route to based on load/ToD)? PS - I appreciate you coming here and commenting!

>>> **derwiki**: Has this always been the case?

>>> **fragmede**: I believe you when you say you're not changing the model file loaded onto the H100s or whatever, but there's something going on, beyond just being slower, when the GPUs are heavily loaded.

>> **Corence**: It is a fair question. I'd expect the numbers are all real. Competitors are going to rerun the benchmark with these models to see how the model is responding and succeeding on the tasks and use that...

>>> **mrandish**: > I'd expect the numbers are all real. I think a lot of people are concerned due to 1) significant variance in performance being reported by a large number of users, and 2) We have specific examples...

>> **ifwinterco**: On benchmarks GPT 5.2 was roughly equivalent to Opus 4.5 but most people who've used both for SWE stuff would say that Opus 4.5 is/was noticeably better

>>> **CraigJPerry**: There's an extended thinking mode for GPT 5.2 i forget the name of it right at this minute. It's super slow - a 3 minute opus 4.5 prompt is circa 12 minutes to complete in 5.2 on that super extended...

>>> **elAhmo**: I mostly used Sonnet/Opus 4.x in the past months, but 5.2 Codex seemed to be on par or better for my use case in the past month. I tried a few models here and there but always went back to Claude,...

>>> **georgeven**: Interesting. Everyone in my circle said the opposite.

>>> **SatvikBeri**: I pretty consistently heard people say Codex was much slower but produced better results, making it better for long-running work in the background, and worse for more interactive development.

>> **smcleod**: I don't think much from OpenAI can be trusted tbh.

>> **aaaalone**: At the end of the day you test it for your use cases anyway but it makes it a great initial hint if it's worth it to test out.

>> **cyanydeez**: When do you think we should run this benchmark? Friday, 1pm? Monday 8AM? Wednesday 11AM? I definitely suspect all these models are being degraded during heavy loads.

>>> **j_maffe**: This hypothesis is tested regularly by plenty of live benchmarks. The services usually don't decay in performance.

>> **thinkingtoilet**: We know Open AI got caught getting benchmark data and tuning their models to it already. So the answer is a hard no. I imagine over time it gives a general view of the landscape and improvements, but...

>>> **tedsanders**: Are you referring to FrontierMath? We had access to the eval data (since we funded it), but we didn't train on the data or otherwise cheat. We didn't even look at the eval results until after the...

> **purplerabbit**: The lack of broad benchmark reports in this makes me curious: Has OpenAI reverted to benchmaxxing? Looking forward to hearing opinions once we all try both of these out

>> **MallocVoidstar**: The -codex models are only for 'agentic coding', nothing else.

> **callamdelaney**: Anthropic models generally are right first time for me. Chatgpt and Gemini are often way, way out with some fundamental misunderstanding of the task at hand.

> **nharada**: That's a massive jump, I'm curious if there's a materially different feeling in how it works or if we're starting to reach the point of benchmark saturation. If the benchmark is good then 10 points...

> **jkelleyrtp**: claude swe-bench is 80.8 and codex is 56.8 Seems like 4.6 is still all-around better?

>> **gizmodo59**: Its SWE bench pro not swe bench verified. The verified benchmark has stagnated

>>> **joshuahedlund**: Any ideas why verified has stagnated? It was increasing rapidly and then basically stopped.

>> **Rudybega**: You're comparing two different benchmarks.  Pro vs Verified.

**insomagent**: I'm not super impressed with the performance, actually.  I'm finding that it misunderstands me quite a bit.  While it is definitely better at reading big codebases and finding a needle in a haystack,...

> **soulofmischief**: I am having trouble with 4.6 following the most basic of instructions. As an example, I asked it to commit everything in the worktree. I stressed everything and prompted it very explicitly, because...

>> **scwoodal**: Tell it what git commands to explicitly run and in what order for your desired outcome instead of “commit everything in the worktree” This prompt will work better across any/all models.

>>> **flutas**: It's a lot more iffy than that IME. It's very happy to throw a lot into the memory, even if it doesn't make sense.

>> **om8**: Is there a way to disable it? Sometimes I value agent not having knowledge that it needs to cut corners

>>> **nerdsniper**: 90-98% of the time I want the LLM to only have the knowledge I gave it in the prompt. I'm actually kind of scared that I'll wake up one day and the web interface for ChatGPT/Opus/Gemini will pull...

>>> **kzahel**: Claude told me he can disable it by putting instructions in the MEMORY.md file to not use it. So only a soft disable AFAIK and you'd need to do it on each machine.

>> **codethief**: Are we sure the docs page has been updated yet? Because that page doesn't say anything about automatic recording of memories.

>>> **neuronexmachina**: Oh, quite right. I saw people mention MEMORY.md online and I assumed that was the doc for it, but it looks like it isn't.

>> **4b11b4**: I understand everyone's trying to solve this problem but I'm envisioning 1 year down the line when your memory is full of stuff that shouldn't be in there.

>> **kzahel**: I looked into it a bit. It stores memories near where it stores JSONL session history. It's per-project (and specific to the machine) Claude pretty aggressively and frequently writes stuff in there....

>> **pdntspa**: I thought it was already doing this? I asked Claude UI to clear its memory a little while back and hoo boy CC got really stupid for a couple of days

>> **cryptoegorophy**: Then why are they advertising to people that are complete opposite of you? Why couldn’t they just … ask LLM what their target audience is?

>> **apples_oranges**: fyi in settings, you can configure chatGPT to do the same

>>> **matkoniecz**: where?

>> **tsss**: Quickly and concisely? In my experience, Claude drivels on and on forever. The answers are always far longer than Gemini's, which is mostly fine for coding but annoying for planning/questions.

>>> **Squarex**: The voice mode sounded like a Ukrainian trying to speak Czech. I don’t think it means anything.

>> **quietsegfault**: Claude is far superior for daily chat. I have to work hard to get it to not learn how to work around various bad behaviors I have but don’t want to change.

> **dimgl**: I don't get what's so difficult to understand. They have ambitions beyond just coding. And Claude is generally a good LLM. Even beyond just the coding applications.

> **fnordpiglet**: Enterprise, government, and regulated institutions. It’s also defacto standard for programming assistants at most places. They have a better story around compliance, alignment, task based inference,...

> **redox99**: Why would I even use Claude for asking something on their web, considering that chips away my claude code usage limit? Their limit system is so bad.

> **derwiki**: It feels very similar to how Lyft positioned themselves against Uber. (And we know how that played out)

> **dev1ycan**: Their "constitution" is just garbage meant to defend them ripping off copyrighted material with the excuse that "it's not plagiarizing, it thinks!!!!1" which is, false.

>> **handoflixue**: I don't recall them ever offering that legal reasoning - I'm sure you can provide a citation?

**DanielHall**: A bit surprised, the first one released wasn't Sonnet 5 after all, since the Google Cloud API had leaked Sonnet 5's model snapshot codename before.

> **denysvitali**: Looks like a marketing strategy to bill more for Opus than Sonnet

**data-ottawa**: I wonder if I’ve been in A/B test with this. Claude figured out zig’s ArrayList and io changes a couple weeks ago. It felt like it got better then very dumb again the last few days.

**vinhnx**: Just used Opus 4.6 via GitHub Copilot. It feels very different. Inference seems slow for now. I guess Opus 4.6 has adaptive thinking activated by default.

**anupamchugh**: Agent teams nuke your tmux layout. The fix is one line: new-window instead of split-pane. Filed as a bug.

**nomilk**: Is Opus 4.6 available for Claude Code immediately? Curious how long it typically takes for a new model to become available in Cursor?

> **apetresc**: I literally came to HN to check if a thread was already up because I noticed my CC instance suddenly said "Opus 4.6".

> **world2vec**: `claude update` then it will show up as the new model and also the effort picker/slider thing.

> **avaer**: It's already in Cursor. I see it and I didn't even restart.

>> **nomilk**: I had to 'Restart to Update' and it was there. Impressive!

> **tomtomistaken**: Yes, it's set to the default model.

> **ximeng**: Is for me in Claude Code

> **rishabhaiover**: it also has an effort toggle which is default to High

**archb**: Can set it with the API identifier on Claude Code - `/model claude-opus-4-6` when a chat session is open.

> **arnestrickmann**: thanks!

**kmod**: I think it's interesting that they dropped the date from the API model name, and it's just called "claude-opus-4-6", vs the previous was "claude-opus-4-5-20251101". This isn't an alias like...

**Aeroi**: ($10/$37.50 per million input/output tokens) oof

> **minimaxir**: Only if you go above 200k, which is a) standard with other model providers and b) intuitive as compute scales with context length.

**ra**: Why are Anthropic such a horrible company to deal with?

**winterrx**: Agentic search benchmarks are a big gap up. let's see Codex release later today

**osti**: Somehow regresses on SWE bench?

> **lkbm**: I don't know how these benchmarks work (do you do a hundred runs? A thousand runs?), but 0.1% seems like noise.

> **SubiculumCode**: That benchmark is pretty saturated, tbh. A "regression" of such small magnitude could mean many different things or nothing at all.

> **usaar333**: i'd interpret that as rounding error. that is unchanged swe-bench seems really hard once you are above 80%

>> **Squarex**: it's not a great benchmark anymore... starting with it being python / django primarily... the industry should move to something more representative

>>> **usaar333**: Openai has; they don't even mention score on gpt-5.3-codex. On the other hand, it is their own verified benchmark, which is telling.

**m-hodges**: > In Claude Code, you can now assemble agent teams to work on tasks together.

**rob**: System Card: https://www-cdn.anthropic.com/0dd865075ad3132672ee0ab40b05a5...

**niobe**: Is there a good technical breakdown of all these benchmarks that get used to market the latest greatest LLMs somewhere? Preferably impartial.

> **Aztar**: I just ask claude and ask for sources for each one.

>> **niobe**: Reminds me of how if you make a complaint against a lawyer or a judge it's evaluated by lawyers and judges.

**kingstnap**: I was hoping for a Sonnet as well but Opus 4.6 is great too!

**paxys**: Hmm all leaks had said this would be Claude 5. Wonder if it was a last minute demotion due to performance. Would explain the few days' delay as well.

> **trash_cat**: I think the naming schemes are quite arbitrary at this point. Going to 5 would come with massive expectations that wouldn't meet reality.

>> **mrandish**: After the negative reactions to GPT 5, we may see model versioning that asymptotically approaches the next whole number without ever reaching it. "New for 2030: Claude 4.9.2!"

>>> **esafak**: Or approaching a magic number like e (Metafont) or π (TeX).

>> **Squarex**: the standard used to be that major version means a new base model / full retrain... but now it is arbitrary i guess

> **cornedor**: Leaks were mentioning Sonnet 5 and I guess later (a combination of) Opus 4.6

> **scrollop**: Sonnet 5 was mentioned initially.

**sanufar**: Works pretty nicely for research still, not seeing a substantial qualitative improvement over Opus 4.5.

**zingar**: Does this mean 4.5 will get cheaper / take longer to exhaust my pro plan tokens?

**EcommerceFlow**: Anecdotal, but it 1 shot fixed a UI bug that neither Opus 4.5/Codex 5.2-high could fix.

> **epolanski**: +1, same experience, switched model as I've read the news thinking "let's try". But it spent lots and lots of time thinking more than 4.5, did you had the same impression.

>> **EcommerceFlow**: I didn't compare to that level, just had it create a plan first then implemented it.

**mannanj**: Does anyone else think its unethical that large companies, Anthropic now include, just take and copy features that other developers or smaller companies work hard for and implement the intellectual...

> **danielbln**: So send off haiku subtasks and have them come back with the results.

**scirob**: 1M context window is a big bump very happy

**small_model**: I have the max subscription wondering if this gives access to the new 1M context, or is it just the API that gets it?

> **joshstrange**: For now it's just API, but hopefully that's just their way of easing in and they open it up later.

>> **small_model**: Ok thanks, hopefully, its annoying to lose or have context compacted in the middle of a large coding session

**dk8996**: RIP weekend

**ricrom**: They launched together ahah

**jdthedisciple**: For agentic use, it's slightly worse than its predecessor Opus 4.5. So for coding e.g. using Copilot there is no improvement here.

**gallerdude**: Both Opus 4.6 and GPT-5.3 one shot a Gameboy emulator for me. Guess I need a better benchmark.

> **peab**: How does that work? Does it actually generate low level code? Or does it just import libraries that do the real work?

**elliotbnvl**: in a first for our Opus-class models, Opus 4.6 features a 1M token context window in beta.

## Summary

Apple announced a partnership with Google to use Gemini as the foundational AI technology powering Siri, marking one of the most significant strategic moves in the AI industry. The deal, reportedly valued near $1 billion, represents Apple's acknowledgment that building competitive frontier AI models in-house is not where their advantage lies.

Apple's decision was driven by several practical realities. Despite having world-class edge inference silicon through their Neural Engine, Apple has effectively zero presence in training datacenters -- lacking the TPU pods or GPU clusters needed to train frontier models from scratch. Google, by contrast, has deep pockets, enterprise infrastructure experience, and diversified revenue streams that make them a stable long-term partner.

Apple confirmed the Gemini models would run under their Private Cloud Compute infrastructure, meaning Google would not have access to Siri user data. This addresses the privacy concern that many in the Apple ecosystem raised immediately upon hearing the news. The deal also has competitive implications: OpenAI had previously integrated with Siri but apparently lost the opportunity.

The announcement signals a broader industry trend where AI models are becoming commodities, and the billions required to train state-of-the-art models may not justify the investment for companies whose core competencies lie elsewhere. Apple appears to have strategically decided to wait until the AI market stabilizes before investing heavily in their own solutions, leveraging their existing device ecosystem as their competitive moat.

## Key Insights

- **Build vs. buy for AI**: Apple chose to partner rather than build, recognizing frontier model training is not their competitive advantage
- **Privacy through architecture**: Running Gemini under Apple's Private Cloud Compute addresses data privacy concerns without sacrificing capability
- **Models as commodities**: The deal reflects a growing view that AI models are becoming interchangeable, and differentiation lies in integration and user experience

**elzbardico**: Models are becoming commodities, and their economy doesn't justify the billions required to train a SOTA model.  Apple just recognized that.

**golfer**: Is the era of Apple exceptionalism over? Has it been over for a while now?

**m3kw9**: Apple is buying time for another shot, right now they are in over their heads on AI and they need a fresh start. Eventually they will own the tech from bottom up, that’s the goal at least

**submeta**: I hope Apple will make it a smooth integration. The chatgpt integration in Apple Intelligence is not smooth. Constantly wants user input („confirm you are 13+“ at every request)

**syngrog66**: I used Gemini heavily in 2025. It was very bad and frustrating to use. Shame on Google for shipping it in the condition they did. No quality control. No pride in craft.

>> **Noaidi**: I have a current case open with Apple with this issue. It does not work. And I don’t believe you. I’m sorry I just don’t believe you because Apple says there is a technical problem preventing this....

>> **Noaidi**: TRY IT!

>>> **runjake**: I did. It works, as far as I can tell?

> **rvz**: You're using Siri? lmao That's the Internet Explorer of chatbots.

>> **Angostura**: That's where people get confused - it's not a chatbot or an LLM - it's a voice command interface. Adding something to the shopping list, setting a timer, turning up the heating in the back room,...

>>> **HarHarVeryFunny**: Siri is already transitioning from an intent-based NLU system to an LLM. In iOS 18.1 (on iPhone 15+) Siri is part intent-based, part on-device "Apple Intelligence" small LLM, and in iOS 18.2 it also...

>> **Noaidi**: Jeez, I only use it for the time and for the calculator, and to ask it to call someone. I am shocked anyone thinks I used it for anything more than that. Also, I have never turned on Apple...

> **volemo**: You’ve used Siri before?! /j

**kachapopopow**: given that gemini 3 pro is presumably a relatively small model it wouldn't be too surprising to see an even more optimized model fit into latest iphones. I wish we knew the data behind gemini 3 flash...

> **mudkipdev**: Google has Gemini Nano for on-device capabilities but basically never uses it and defers to cloud models instead

**ProofHouse**: It tells you how bad their product management and engineering team is that they haven’t just decided to kill Siri and start from scratch. Siri is utterly awful and that’s an understatement, for at...

**dubeye**: Oh God, please do this tomorrow.

**thayne**: This seems like a pretty significant anti-trust issue. One of the two mobile OS makers is using a product from the other for its AI assistance. And that means that basically all mobile devices will...

> **qnpnpmqppnp**: What antitrust rule do you think would be breached? I admit I don't see the issue here. Companies are free to select their service providers, and free to dominate a market (as long as they don't...

>> **benoau**: Gatekeeping - nobody else can be the default voice assistant or power Siri, so where does this leave eg OpenAI?  The reason this is important is their DOJ antitrust case, about to start trial, has...

>>> **its_ethan**: So because Apple chose not to spend money to develop it's own AI, it must be punished for then choosing to use another companies model? And the reason that this is an issue is because both companies...

>>> **KerrAvon**: IANAL, but I don't believe either of these things is a recognized concept in US antitrust law.

>>> **qnpnpmqppnp**: > Gatekeeping - nobody else can be the default voice assistant or power Siri, so where does this leave eg OpenAI? Sorry if I'm missing the point but if Apple had picked OpenAI, couldn't you have made...

>> **thayne**: Apple and Google have a duopoly on Mobile OS. If Apple uses Google's model for Siri, that means Apple and Google are using their duopoly in one market (mobile OS) to enforce a monopoly for Google in...

>>> **qnpnpmqppnp**: They are in a duopoly on the Mobile OS market, with no other significant player available. Google would be the sole integrated mobile AI, though there are competitors available if customers wanted to...

**mberning**: Total capitulation by Apple.

**narrator**: I always said that Apple does not have the cloud GPU power to deliver a good AI experience to their huge customer base, no matter how good their developers are.  They have to find someone with a lot...

**nish__**: At what point are they going to just ship iPhones with Android?

> **suddenexample**: I mean never... but what a dream that would be

**varispeed**: Gemini still easily goes into loops and produces nonsense.

**dhruv3006**: Didn't they make a deal with OpenAI sometime back?

> **flanbiscuit**: ChatGPT is currently integrated into Apple Intelligence. When I ask Siri something I can choose to use ChatGPT for my answer. https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/use-chatgpt-with-appl... So I'm...

>> **ntonozzi**: Hopefully it gets more tightly integrated.

**toroszo**: can they ask siri to fix the tahoe catastrophe please

**code51**: Weird thing is, Gemini didn't crack speech-to-speech yet. They have a product but both Anthropic and Google are visibly suffering in speech-to-speech vs OpenAI voice mode.

**system2**: Just like that, we have a final AI winner.

**worldsavior**: How Apple has made some of the greatest phones in history, amazing engineering, and a lot more, but just can't make a simple model to run locally on the phone when many others did?

**didntknowyou**: i think it's good. Google has a record of being stable and working with large partners (govt etc) and avoids the controversial cult of altman.

**34679**: Apple picks [ad company's] [ai ad server] to power Siri.

**soperj**: It's hilarious how Apple can't compete in the space and so many people here are just saying "Smart move by Apple" as if they had another choice at this point.  It's not like they haven't tried.

> **pretext-1**: If they wanted to, they could throw massive amounts of cash on it like Google and Facebook are, with the latter poaching Apple employees with 200$ million pay packages:...

>> **soperj**: Why did they even have Ruoming Pang on staff? Because they were trying. Failing, and then saying we're waiting is objectively hilarious.

>> **asadotzler**: No, they couldn't, because all current and future ethe training hardware is already tied up by contracts from the frontier labs. Apple could not simply buy its way in given how constricted the supply...

>>> **pretext-1**: You can rent data centers for this stuff nowadays and Apple can easily outbid any competitor.

**Animats**: Will Apple and Google merge now? That would create a new #1, bigger than NVidia. It would take US antitrust approval, but under Trump, that's for sale.

**andy_ppp**: In other news Yahoo! picks Bing to become its new search engine... This is that stupid.

**klglrksbjkt**: But, but, didn’t they say two years ago that they picked OpenAI to power apple intelligence? Where did that go? Wasn’t Scam Altman gay enough for Tim Apple?

**fcksirinckel**: Now I have two reasons to not use Siri.

**willdotphipps**: Why couldn't Apple pull their finger out of their asses and make their own AI nonsense better then Crap GPT?

**oojuliuso**: Steve Jobs rolling in his grave. The mortal enemy. Thermonuclear war.

> **benoau**: Enemies?  Google contributes about 20% of Apple's profits annually through their default search engine deal, that's more profitable than just about everything they do or make except selling iPhones....

> **golfer**: The original iPhone came pre-loaded with Google search, Maps, and Youtube. Jobs competed with Google but he also knew Google had best-in-class products too.

> **relium**: Jobs brokered a $150M deal with Apple's arch enemy Microsoft in 1997.

## Summary

This article from the "Where's Your Ed At" newsletter by Ed Zitron presents a detailed case for how the AI bubble might collapse in 2026. The analysis focuses on three interconnected pressure points: OpenAI's cash crisis, data center financing difficulties, and delayed infrastructure rollouts.

On the financial side, the article argues that OpenAI lacks sufficient capital to fund its massive infrastructure ambitions. It cites examples like Disney's licensing deal being paid entirely in stock warrants rather than cash, and Amazon investing $10 billion into OpenAI so that OpenAI can pay AWS back -- a circular arrangement that highlights the company's capital constraints.

The data center financing picture is also deteriorating. Blue Owl Capital, described as one of the most accommodating lenders in the data center space, withdrew from a $10 billion Michigan facility deal. The article interprets this as a signal that credit conditions across the sector are tightening, with lenders pushing for stricter leasing and debt terms.

Multiple 2026 infrastructure milestones are slipping. CoreWeave's Denton facility faced significant weather delays, Oracle pushed back OpenAI data center completion dates, and Broadcom indicated it expected minimal 2026 revenue from its OpenAI contract. The article frames these delays as a cascading chain reaction that will ripple through AI startups and GPU demand.

Perhaps most notably, the article observes a shift in market sentiment. Where AI announcements once triggered large stock price increases, investors are now questioning financial viability. Companies like Oracle and Broadcom saw their stock decline despite beating earnings expectations.

## Key Insights

- **Infrastructure financing as the chokepoint**: The AI buildout depends on massive data center investment, and tightening credit conditions could constrain the entire ecosystem before the technology itself hits limits.
- **Circular financing structures**: Deals where investors fund OpenAI so it can pay their own cloud services back reveal the fragile financial engineering underlying current AI expansion.
- **Sentiment reversal in markets**: The shift from AI announcements boosting stocks to investors questioning viability signals a potential phase change in the hype cycle.
- **Cascading delay effects**: Individual project delays compound across the ecosystem, affecting startups, GPU demand, and the timeline for AI infrastructure that current business plans assume.

**AI Capability Skepticism**
- **jqpabc123**: Argued that the bubble bursts when corporate management realizes that current AI struggles with basic math and logic, has no real-world experience, and cannot distinguish fact from fiction. Compared adopting AI to hiring workers without adequate skills simply because they are cheaper.

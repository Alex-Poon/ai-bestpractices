## Summary

This post by @slow_developer on X (formerly Twitter) argues that the shift from 2025 to 2026 in AI-assisted coding has been defined by a fundamental rebalancing: model choice now outweighs prompt engineering as the primary lever for coding quality. Where 2025 workflows focused heavily on crafting precise prompts and structuring interactions carefully, the advancements in frontier models have made the underlying model capability the dominant factor in output quality.

The author follows up on their 2025 workflows to explore the transition from manual prompting to agentic feedback loops. Claude Code has become their primary development driver alongside Cursor, and they characterize the current AI capability level as roughly equivalent to a "SWE II" (mid-level software engineer) — capable but requiring a new form of oversight and collaboration rather than the micromanagement that weaker models demanded.

The core argument is that as models improve, the marginal return on prompt engineering diminishes. A strong model with a simple prompt will outperform a weak model with an elaborate prompt. This does not mean prompting is irrelevant, but rather that the optimization priority should shift: choose the best available model first, then optimize your prompting and workflow around its specific capabilities.

## Key Insights

- **Model capability now dominates**: The quality gap between frontier and non-frontier models matters more than prompt sophistication
- **Shift from prompting to agentic loops**: The evolution is from carefully crafted one-shot prompts toward feedback loops where agents iterate on their own output
- **AI at "SWE II" level**: Current frontier models operate at approximately the level of a mid-level software engineer, capable but requiring oversight
- **Prompt engineering still matters, but less**: Diminishing marginal returns on prompting as model capability rises

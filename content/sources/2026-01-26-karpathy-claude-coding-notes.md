## Summary

Andrej Karpathy shared a widely discussed thread of observations from extensive Claude Code usage. His notes touched on several key themes that resonated deeply with the developer community, generating nearly 100 HN comments and over 900 upvotes.

One of Karpathy's central observations was around the tension between AI-assisted productivity and personal skill development. He noted that he was already experiencing atrophy in his ability to write code manually, finding it harder to recall syntax and implementation details. However, he argued this might be acceptable since code review skills remain intact even as writing fluency declines, drawing a parallel to how reading comprehension persists even when spelling ability degrades.

He highlighted agent tenacity as a striking quality: AI agents never tire or get demoralized, continuing to work through problems where a human would have given up. He described watching an agent struggle for 30 minutes before succeeding as a visceral demonstration of what abundant computational persistence can achieve.

Karpathy predicted that AI-assisted coding would create a split between engineers who primarily enjoy the craft of coding itself and those who primarily enjoy building products. The builder-oriented engineers would embrace AI tools enthusiastically while craft-oriented programmers would feel their identity threatened.

He also warned about the coming wave of AI-generated low-quality content across platforms, coining the concept of a content quality decline across GitHub, Substack, arXiv, and social media. Despite these concerns, he maintained that IDEs remain valuable, as the visual diff review workflow is essential for maintaining code quality when working with AI agents.

## Key Insights

- **Skill atrophy is real but manageable**: Code writing fluency degrades with AI use, but code review abilities persist, suggesting a natural evolution of the developer role
- **Agent tenacity as competitive advantage**: AI agents' inability to get tired or demoralized enables solving problems that humans would abandon, representing a genuine capability expansion
- **Builder vs coder split**: AI will widen the gap between product-oriented and craft-oriented engineers, with different groups having fundamentally different reactions to AI tools
- **IDEs still matter**: Despite the power of CLI agents, visual code review through IDE diffs remains essential for quality control
- **Content quality concerns**: AI-generated slop will increasingly flood repositories and knowledge platforms in 2026

> **20260126032624**: I don't "vibe code" but when I use an LLM with a game I usually branch out into several experiments which I don't have to commit to. Thus, it just makes that iteration process go faster. Or slower,...

> **TheGRS**: I'm trying it out with Godot for my little side projects. It can handle writing the GUI files for nodes and settings. The workflow is asking cursor to change something, I review the code changes,...

> **dysoco**: It might be biased to Reddit/Twitter users but from what I've seen game developers seem to be much more averse towards using AI (even for coding) than other fields. Which is curious since prototyping...

> **redox99**: Vibe coding in Unreal Engine is of limited use. It obviously helps with C++, but so much of your time is doing things that are not C++. It hurts a lot that UE relies heavily on blueprints, if they...

> **ex-aws-dude**: A big problem is that a lot of game logic is done in visual scripting (e.g unreal blueprints) which AI tools have no idea about

**TrackerFF**: Minor nitpick: The original measure of a 10x programmer was not the productivity multiplier max/mean, but rather max/min.

**nadis**: The section on IDEs/agent swarms/fallibility resonated a lot for me; I haven't gone quite as far as Karpathy in terms of power usage of Claude Code, but some of the shifts in mistakes (and reality...

**hollowturtle**: > Coding workflow. Given the latest lift in LLM coding capability, like many others I rapidly went from about 80% manual+autocomplete coding and 20% agents in November to 80% agent coding and 20%...

> **TaupeRanger**: Lots of very scared, angry developers in these comment sections recently...

>> **hollowturtle**: Not angry nor scared, I value my hard skills a lot, I'm just wondering why people believe religiously everything AI related. Maybe I'm a bit sick with the excessive hype

>>> **jofla_net**: FOMO really

>> **crystal_revenge**: There's no fear (a bit of anger I must admit). I suspect nearly all of the reaction against this comes from a similar place to where mine does: All of the real world code I have had to review created...

>> **hollowturtle**: Also note that I'm a heavy LLM user, not anti ai for sure

>> **Banditoz**: This is extremely reductive and incredibly dismissive of everything they wrote above.

>>> **crystal_revenge**: It's because they don't have a substantive response to it, so they resort to ad hominems. I've worked extensively in the AI space, and believe that it is extremely useful, but these weird claims...

>> **thr59182617**: I see way more hype that is boosted by the moderators. The scared ones are the nepo babies who founded a vaporware AI company that will be bought by daddy or friends through a VC. They have to...

>>> **razodactyl**: society doesn't take kindly to the hyper-aware. tone it down.

>>> **simianwords**: i'm not sure what kind of conspiracy you are hallucinating. do you think people have to "maintain the hype"? it is doing quite well organically.

> **simianwords**: This is a low quality curmudgeonly comment

>> **hollowturtle**: Now that you contributed zero net to the discussion and learned a new word you can go out and play with toys! Good job

>> **potatogun**: You learned a new adjective? If people move beyond "nice", "mean" and "curmudgeonly" they might even read Shakespeare instead of having an LLM producing a summary.

>>> **simianwords**: cool. >Anyone wondering what exactly is he actually building? What? Where? this is trivially answerable. it seems like they did not do even the slightest bit of research before asking question after...

**DeathArrow**: >LLM coding will split up engineers based on those who primarily liked coding and those who primarily liked building. Quite insightful.

**appstorelottery**: > Atrophy. I've already noticed that I am slowly starting to atrophy my ability to write code manually. I've been increasingly using LLM's to code for nearly two years now - and I can definitely...

> **epolanski**: Don't be too worried about it. 1. Manual coding may be less relevant (albeit ability to read code, interpret it and understand it will be more) in the future. Likely already is. 2. Any skill you...

>> **appstorelottery**: Thanks for your comment, it set me at ease. I know from experience that you're right on point 2. As for point one, I also tend to agree. AI is such a paradigm shift & rapid/massive change doesn't...

**dzonga**: maybe its just me doing stuff that's out the usual loop even dealing with api's that have MCP servers the so called agents make a mess of everything. my stuff is just regular data stuff - ingest data...

**dubeye**: the xcancel link is amusing. 9/10 of the most important social media users use X, like or loath it

**ares623**: Imagine taking career advice from people who will never need to be employed again in order to survive.

> **fragmede**: Yes, typically you take since from people who've been successful at their career. Are you suggesting we should be taking career advice from high school freshmen instead?

>> **ares623**: I'm nitpicking on the atrophy bit. He can afford to have his skills or his brain atrophied. His followers though? Nevermind the fact he became successful _because_ of his skills and his brain.

**trivo**: I sometimes wonder about the similarities between this paradigm switch (coding -> vibe coding) and when the industry switched from writing assembler to using high-level languages. I both cases we...

**felineflock**: xcancel? What is the purpose or benefit of providing a free mirror to x? Doesn't it end up sparing the x servers and causing their costs to decrease?

> **moss_dog**: I prefer xcancel in part because Twitter doesn't let you view replies etc when not logged in.

> **yojat661**: Guessing x loses ad revenue when traffic goes to xcancel.

> **tryauuum**: my screen is 60 percent banners about cookies and account creation when I use x

**upghost**: tl;dr - All this AI stuff is just Universal Paperclips[1] I see a lot of comments about folks being worried about going soft, getting brain rot, or losing the fun part of coding. As far as I'm...

>> **Havoc**: Including classified systems. What could possibly go wrong

>> **blibble**: the US is going to stop the chinese by mass production of illegal pornography?

> **groby_b**: fwiw, the same is true for humans. Which is why there's a whole lot of process and red tape around that button. We know how to manage risk. We can choose to do that for LLM usage, too. If instead we...

**solarized**: Next milestone: solving authoritarian LLM dependencies. We can’t always get trapped in local minima. Or is that actually okay?

**superze**: I don't know about you guys but most of the time it's spitting nonsense models in sqlalchemy and I have to constantly correct it to the point where I am back at writing the code myself. The bugs are...

**jbjbjbjb**: > do generalists outperform specialists? Depends what we mean by specialist. If it frontend vs backend then maybe. If it general dev vs some specialist scientific programmer or other field where a...

**randoglando**: Senpai has taken the words out of my mouth and put them on the page.

**seffietron**: At the risk of exposing my... atypical take on contemporary occupational "morality". LLMs, and Claude Code specifically, have given me the ability to work two jobs, and retain my soft-standing as the...

> **rikdom**: Honestly man, this is totally understandable. It's a rat race, and if you don't use the tools at your disposal, you'll be left behind.

**spaceman_2020**: Once again, 80% of the comments here are from boomers. HN used to be a proper place for people actually curious about technology

> **vardalab**: I'm almost a boomer and I agree.  THis dichotomy is weird.  I am retired EE and I love the ability to just have AI do whatever I want for me.  I have it manage a 10 node proxmox cluster in my...

>> **kejaed**: So what is your workflow now with this app for kids sports highlights?

>>> **vardalab**: Well, it's not really a full-blown app yet. Claude wrote a plugin for MPV. So now when I watch video I just push a button to mark in and out of highlights similar to how it works in DaVinci Resolve....

>>> **zennit**: Also interested

>> **kakapo5672**: Same demographic, same experience.  AI has been incredibly liberating for me. I get all sorts of things done now that before were previosly impossible for all practical purposes.  Among other things,...

> **weirdmantis69**: Ya it's so weird lol

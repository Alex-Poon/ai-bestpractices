If you are new to AI-assisted development --- or if you have been using AI tools but feel like you are not getting consistent value --- start with these two pages.

**[The Core Loop: Plan, Delegate, Verify, Harness](/start-here/core-loop/)** is the central framework. Every technique, pattern, and checklist on this site maps back to one of these four phases. Read this first.

**[The Adoption Curve: Where Are You?](/start-here/adoption-stages/)** describes the six stages developers move through as they adopt AI coding agents. Understanding where you are in the progression tells you what to practice next and what pitfalls to expect.

Once you have those foundations, explore the rest of the site based on what you need:

- **[Patterns](/patterns/)** --- Reusable solutions to common problems: [Task Scoping](/patterns/task-scoping/), [Harness Engineering](/patterns/harness-engineering/), and [Parallel Agent Coordination](/patterns/parallel-agent-coordination/).
- **[References](/references/)** --- Quick-access resources like the [Daily Workflow Checklist](/references/daily-workflow-checklist/) and the [AGENTS.md Guide](/references/agents-md-guide/).
- **[Sources](/sources/)** --- The full library of practitioner articles and community discussions that underpin everything here.

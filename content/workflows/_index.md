The patterns and skills in this knowledge base are only useful if they translate into daily habits. This section covers the concrete workflows that practitioners use to integrate AI tools into their development process -- from morning routines to multi-agent orchestration to configuring the files that give agents persistent memory.

**[Daily Practice](/workflows/daily-practice/)** -- A practical checklist for structuring your day around AI-assisted development. Covers session management, delegation decisions, and the review discipline that separates productive use from accumulated drift.

**[Parallel Agent Coordination](/workflows/parallel-agents/)** -- When and how to run multiple AI agents on a single project. Covers coordination strategies, the infrastructure that makes parallelism work, and the failure modes that make it waste money.

**[AGENTS.md Guide](/workflows/agents-md-guide/)** -- The evidence-backed approach to writing the configuration files that give agents persistent, project-specific memory. Includes templates, maintenance discipline, and the eval data showing why passive context outperforms active retrieval.

**[The Vibe Coding Spectrum](/workflows/vibe-coding-spectrum/)** -- Understanding the range from rapid prototyping to production engineering, and choosing the right level of rigor for each situation.

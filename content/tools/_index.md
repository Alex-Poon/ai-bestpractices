The AI coding tool landscape is moving faster than any static comparison can capture. Models improve monthly, pricing shifts quarterly, new entrants appear constantly. Nearly $2 billion has been raised by coding agent startups in just the past five months.

Rather than ranking tools, this section profiles each major player based on practitioner experience and community discussion. The goal is to help you understand what each tool does well, where it falls short, and how it fits into a broader workflow.

## The Fundamental Split

The most important distinction is between **autocomplete** tools (inline suggestions as you type) and **agentic** tools (autonomous task execution with file editing, command running, and iterative error correction). Some tools offer both; the question is which mode is first-class.

- **Autocomplete-first**: GitHub Copilot
- **Agentic-first**: Claude Code, Amp Code
- **Hybrid**: Cursor (both modes as first-class features)

## What Is Covered Here

- [Claude Code](/tools/claude-code.html) -- Anthropic's CLI-first agent, with deep dives on swarms, LSP support, and AGENTS.md
- [Cursor](/tools/cursor.html) -- The AI-native IDE fork of VS Code
- [Amp Code](/tools/amp.html) -- Sourcegraph's multi-model coding agent
- [GitHub Copilot](/tools/copilot.html) -- The original AI coding assistant
- [The MCP Ecosystem](/tools/mcp-ecosystem.html) -- Model Context Protocol and the interoperability layer emerging around it

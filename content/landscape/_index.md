The AI coding landscape in early 2026 is defined by rapid model releases, deepening adoption, real cost pressures, and unresolved debates about where this is all heading.

This section surveys the terrain as of February 2026. It is not a tool comparison (see the [Tool Landscape](/references/tool-landscape/)) or a how-to guide (see [Start Here](/start-here/)). Instead, it captures the broader context that shapes every practitioner decision: which models exist, how far adoption has reached, what the economics look like, and what questions remain genuinely open.

- **[Model Releases in 2026](/landscape/model-releases-2026/)** --- A survey of major model launches from Claude Opus 4.6 to Llama 4, and what they signal about the competitive landscape.
- **[The Adoption Curve](/landscape/adoption-curve/)** --- Where the industry stands on AI-assisted development, from enthusiasts to holdouts.
- **[Costs and Tradeoffs](/landscape/costs-and-tradeoffs/)** --- The real economics of AI coding: what practitioners spend, what breaks, and whether the math works.
- **[Open Questions](/landscape/open-questions/)** --- The debates still raging in the community, from skill atrophy to bubble risk to the future of open source.

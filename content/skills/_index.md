AI-assisted development is not one skill. It is four distinct skills that compound when practiced together.

Most developers focus on prompting -- typing better instructions into a chat window. But the evidence from hundreds of practitioners and multiple studies points to a different set of capabilities that separate effective AI users from frustrated ones.

**[Task Scoping](/skills/task-scoping/)** -- Decomposing work into units that are small enough to verify but large enough to be worth delegating. This is the skill that determines whether AI accelerates you or wastes your time.

**[Harness Engineering](/skills/harness-engineering/)** -- Building persistent infrastructure (AGENTS.md files, custom tools, CI gates) that constrains and guides agents across sessions. This is the highest-leverage investment because it compounds over time.

**[Verification](/skills/verification/)** -- Reading and reviewing AI-generated code effectively. As writing shifts to AI, the ability to evaluate output becomes the developer's primary contribution and the skill that prevents costly errors from reaching production.

**[Model Selection](/skills/model-selection/)** -- Choosing the right model for the right task, balancing capability, cost, and speed. The gap between a well-chosen and poorly-chosen model often matters more than the prompt itself.

These skills are ordered by how early they matter in a typical workflow: you scope first, configure your harness, generate code, verify the output, and choose the right model throughout. But they are not sequential stages -- they reinforce each other. Better scoping makes verification faster. Better harness engineering reduces the need for careful model selection. Stronger verification skills let you scope more aggressively.

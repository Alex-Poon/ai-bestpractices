      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nicholas Carlini set out to answer a simple question: can you build real, production-grade software using nothing but parallel AI agents? The result was a 100,000-line Rust-based C compiler, produced by 16 parallel Claude instances over two weeks, that passed 99% of the GCC torture test suite and compiled the Linux 6.9 kernel across x86, ARM, and RISC-V architectures.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The compiler itself is impressive. But the lasting value of this experiment lies in what it revealed about how autonomous agents succeed and fail at scale &amp;ndash; and why the infrastructure surrounding the agents matters more than the agents themselves.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A single agent is often too slow for large projects. Running multiple agents in parallel is the obvious solution, but naive parallelism introduces failure modes that can waste more time and money than sequential work. This page covers when parallel agents help, when they hurt, and the coordination infrastructure that makes the difference.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The strongest empirical evidence comes from Nicholas Carlini&amp;rsquo;s compiler project, where 16 parallel Claude instances produced 100,000 lines of working Rust compiler code over two weeks. The full case study is covered in &lt;a href=&#34;../../deep-dives/parallel-compiler-lessons/&#34;&gt;What 100 Parallel Agents Taught Us&lt;/a&gt;. This page focuses on the reusable coordination patterns.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anthropic published a randomized controlled study examining how AI assistance affects skill acquisition among junior software engineers. The research involved 52 participants divided into AI-assisted and control groups, tasked with learning and using Trio (a Python asynchronous programming library). After completing coding tasks, participants took a comprehension quiz covering debugging, code reading, code writing, and conceptual understanding.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The results revealed a significant trade-off between speed and learning. The AI-assisted group scored 17% lower on the comprehension quiz, a gap the researchers characterized as equivalent to nearly two letter grades, with a large effect size (Cohen&amp;rsquo;s d of 0.738, p=0.01). The largest performance gap appeared on debugging questions, suggesting that AI assistance particularly impairs the development of error identification skills. Meanwhile, AI users finished tasks roughly two minutes faster on average, though this speed advantage was not statistically significant.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In early 2026, Anthropic published a study examining how AI coding assistance affects developer skill development. The study became one of the most intensely debated pieces of AI research in the developer community, generating over 346 comments on Hacker News. The reaction was notable not for the usual pro/anti-AI polarization but for the depth of personal reflection it provoked &amp;ndash; developers grappling honestly with what they had already noticed happening to their own abilities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

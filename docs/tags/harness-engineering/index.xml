      <title>What 100 Parallel AI Agents Taught Us About Harness Engineering</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you want to understand the future of autonomous AI development, ignore the code and study the harness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Nicholas Carlini&amp;rsquo;s compiler project &amp;ndash; 16 parallel Claude instances producing a 100,000-line Rust-based C compiler over two weeks &amp;ndash; is the most data-rich public experiment in parallel agentic coding to date. The compiler passed 99% of the GCC torture test suite and successfully compiled the Linux 6.9 kernel across x86, ARM, and RISC-V architectures. But the real value of the project lies not in the artifact it produced. It lies in what it revealed about how autonomous agents succeed and fail at scale.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;problem&#34;&gt;Problem&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The agent keeps making the same mistakes. You correct it in-session, it complies, and then the next session it makes the identical error because it has no memory of the previous correction. You find yourself re-explaining the same project conventions, re-specifying the same constraints, and re-fixing the same categories of errors across every interaction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is no institutional memory across sessions. Each session starts from zero.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;solution&#34;&gt;Solution&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Build persistent infrastructure that constrains and guides agents across sessions. This infrastructure &amp;mdash; the &amp;ldquo;harness&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash; takes two complementary forms: documentation files that agents read, and purpose-built tools that agents use.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Six Stages of AI Adoption</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/guides/adoption-stages.html</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Developers who successfully adopt AI coding agents tend to follow the same progression. Not because someone prescribed it, but because each stage builds the calibration and infrastructure required by the next. Skipping stages leads to frustration, wasted effort, and the conclusion that agents do not work &amp;mdash; when the real problem was missing foundations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This framework synthesizes practitioner experience into six stages. Most developers who abandon AI-assisted development get stuck between Stages 1 and 2. Most developers who succeed credit the investments made in Stages 2 and 5.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md Guide</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/references/agents-md-guide.html</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-these-files-are&#34;&gt;What These Files Are&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md are project-root files that AI coding agents read at the start of every session. They give agents persistent, project-specific context that would otherwise be lost between conversations. Different tools use different filenames &amp;ndash; Claude Code reads CLAUDE.md, Amp reads AGENTS.md, and most tools now support both &amp;ndash; but the purpose is identical: tell the agent how to work in this codebase.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-they-matter-the-compounding-effect&#34;&gt;Why They Matter: The Compounding Effect&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Every time you correct an agent&amp;rsquo;s mistake, you face a choice: fix it once and move on, or document the correction so it never happens again. The AGENTS.md file is where those corrections accumulate.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

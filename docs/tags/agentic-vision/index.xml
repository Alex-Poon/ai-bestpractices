      <title>GLM-5: Targeting complex systems engineering and long-horizon agentic tasks</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Zhipu AI (Z.ai) released GLM-5, an open-weight mixture-of-experts model with 744 billion total parameters and 40 billion active parameters, licensed under MIT. The model targets what Z.ai calls &amp;ldquo;agentic engineering&amp;rdquo; — complex, multi-stage systems tasks that require autonomous decomposition of requirements, long-horizon planning, and sustained context coherence across extended workflows.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;GLM-5 scales up from its predecessor GLM-4.7 (368B parameters) with pre-training expanded from 23 trillion to 28.5 trillion tokens. On agentic benchmarks like Vending Bench 2, it claims the top position among open-source models and approaches the performance of proprietary frontier models like Claude Opus 4.5 and GPT-5.2 on reasoning, coding, and long-horizon task execution.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Introducing Agentic Vision in Gemini 3 Flash</title>
      <link>/sources/2026-02-03-gemini-3-agentic-vision.html</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Google introduced Agentic Vision as a new capability in Gemini 3 Flash, transforming image understanding from a static analysis task into a dynamic, action-oriented agentic process. Rather than simply analyzing images in isolation, Agentic Vision enables the model to interact with visual content across multiple steps, potentially examining images iteratively and taking actions based on what it observes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The feature represents a broader trend in AI development where multimodal capabilities are being enhanced with agentic behaviors. Instead of one-shot image analysis where a user submits a photo and receives a description, Agentic Vision allows the model to autonomously decide what to examine more closely, what questions to ask, and what actions to take based on visual inputs. This is particularly relevant for developer tools and automation workflows where visual understanding needs to be combined with decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;These are developers who use AI coding tools daily, have developed sophisticated workflows, and share their techniques with concrete detail. They are not cheerleaders &amp;ndash; most have strong opinions about what works and what does not.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-context-engineer&#34;&gt;The context engineer&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;energy123&lt;/strong&gt; maintains a single markdown file of roughly 15,000 tokens containing his project&amp;rsquo;s entire world model &amp;ndash; use cases, principles, requirements, guardrails, and ambiguity resolutions. This file gets injected into every prompt. Over time, repeated inferences cause the codebase to converge toward the intended design rather than drifting into defaults. He notes this level of investment only pays off for long-lived, important projects.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;These are not people who dismiss AI coding tools without trying them. They are practitioners who have used the tools extensively and articulate specific, concrete concerns. Their critiques are grounded in real failures, not theoretical objections.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-craft-programmer&#34;&gt;The craft programmer&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ryandrake&lt;/strong&gt; got into programming because he enjoys programming &amp;ndash; the act of defining problems in data structures, the puzzle of finding elegant solutions. If he wanted to tell someone else how to do the work, he would have gone into management. AI tools remove the very thing that attracted him to the field.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The most interesting voices in any technology debate are the ones who changed their mind. These practitioners describe a specific before-and-after: a concrete moment or experience that shifted their position. The conversions go both directions &amp;ndash; skeptics who became believers and enthusiasts who developed reservations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;from-ic-to-manager-reluctantly&#34;&gt;From IC to manager (reluctantly)&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;seer&lt;/strong&gt; describes the shift to AI-assisted coding as eerily similar to the jump from individual contributor to manager. He stopped obsessing over implementation details and learned to give guidance instead of instructions. If the AI chose an iterative loop instead of a functional pattern, he let it go &amp;ndash; the tests still pass. The conversion was not instant; it required the same letting-go that management demands.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The best evidence for how AI coding tools actually perform comes not from marketing materials or press releases but from practitioners reporting concrete experiences. The following quotes and observations are drawn from Hacker News discussions that collectively represent thousands of upvotes and hundreds of comments from working developers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Each entry is attributed to its original author and linked to the source discussion. Longer sentiments have been paraphrased to capture the core insight.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;These are the people building the coding agents, harnesses, and infrastructure that everyone else uses. Their perspective is shaped by implementation reality: what actually works at scale, what breaks in production, and what the architecture looks like from the inside.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-moat-analyst&#34;&gt;The moat analyst&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tptacek&lt;/strong&gt; argues that there is no such thing as a frontier agent. While frontier models require massive resources to train, any proficient developer could build a competitive coding agent. The moat, if it exists, is in the engineering of the harness &amp;ndash; not in model access. This reframes the competitive landscape: agents are democratizable in a way that models are not.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Karpathy&#39;s AI Coding Notes: A Deep Reading</title>
      <link>//localhost:1314/evidence/karpathy-notes.html</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In late January 2026, Andrej Karpathy &amp;ndash; former director of AI at Tesla, founding member of OpenAI, and one of the most respected voices in machine learning &amp;ndash; shared a thread of observations from a week of intensive Claude Code usage. The post received 911 upvotes on Hacker News and generated over 800 comments, making it one of the most substantive community discussions on AI-assisted development in the corpus.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What made this discussion exceptional was not Karpathy&amp;rsquo;s observations alone, but the quality of the community response. His notes served as a catalyst for practitioners across the experience spectrum to articulate positions they had been forming through months of daily AI tool usage. The result is a uniquely rich snapshot of how the developer community was processing the AI-assisted coding transition in early 2026.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Prompt craft is the skill of communicating effectively with AI coding agents. It is not the most important skill in AI-assisted development &amp;ndash; &lt;a href=&#34;../task-scoping.html&#34;&gt;task scoping&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;../verification.html&#34;&gt;verification&lt;/a&gt; matter more &amp;ndash; but it is the interface through which every other skill is expressed. A well-scoped task still needs to be communicated clearly. A well-built harness still needs to be written in language the agent processes reliably.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The key insight practitioners have converged on: prompt craft is less about clever techniques and more about providing the right context. The model&amp;rsquo;s behavior is dominated by what you put in front of it, not by how cleverly you phrase the request.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

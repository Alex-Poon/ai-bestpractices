      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-question&#34;&gt;The Question&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Andrej Karpathy, one of the most prominent voices in AI, admitted that he can barely write C++ anymore after years of relying on AI assistants. For many developers, this confession crystallized a fear they had been quietly carrying: that the tools making them faster are simultaneously making them less capable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The atrophy question cuts deeper than the related debate about whether juniors can develop skills with AI assistance. This is about experienced developers &amp;ndash; people who already had hard-won expertise &amp;ndash; watching those abilities fade. It is the difference between never learning to navigate without GPS and being a former navigator who can no longer read a map. The loss feels more personal and more concrete.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

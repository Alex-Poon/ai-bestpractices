      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-question&#34;&gt;The Question&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Something uncomfortable is happening to the developer identity. Tools that were supposed to make programming more productive are instead making some developers feel like they&amp;rsquo;re not programming at all. When your day consists of writing prompts, reviewing AI output, and shepherding agents through tasks, the question becomes unavoidable: is this still engineering?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The tension runs deep because it touches on why people entered the field. Some developers are in it to build things &amp;ndash; shipping products, solving user problems, creating value. For them, AI is a superpower that eliminates the tedious translation between intent and implementation. Others are in it because they love the craft of programming itself &amp;ndash; the elegance of a well-structured algorithm, the satisfaction of making something work through direct understanding. For them, AI threatens the very activity that makes the work meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

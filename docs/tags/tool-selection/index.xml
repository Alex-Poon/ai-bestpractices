      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Addy Osmani, a well-known figure in the web development community, shares his comprehensive approach to AI-augmented software engineering. The central philosophy treats LLMs as powerful pair programmers that require clear direction, context, and human oversight rather than autonomous replacements for developers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The workflow is structured around several core practices. First, planning comes before coding — create detailed specifications, use AI to iteratively flesh out requirements and edge cases, and generate project plans that break work into bite-sized tasks. Osmani describes this as completing a &amp;ldquo;waterfall in 15 minutes&amp;rdquo; to prevent wasted development cycles. Second, iterative chunking — break projects into small manageable pieces rather than requesting monolithic outputs, processing one feature at a time while maintaining context of previous work. Third, context provision — feed the AI all relevant code, documentation, and constraints using tools like gitingest or repo2txt to bundle repository information, and provide style guides through CLAUDE.md files.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

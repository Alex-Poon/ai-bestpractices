      <title>Is the AI Coding Tool Economy Sustainable?</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-question&#34;&gt;The Question&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The AI coding tool economy in early 2026 runs on a contradiction: developers are addicted to tools whose providers are hemorrhaging cash. OpenAI projects billions in losses, Anthropic burns through venture capital to subsidize Claude Code subscriptions, and Google treats Gemini as a loss leader to protect search revenue. Developers pay $20 to $200 per month for tools that consume far more in compute than those subscriptions cover.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Is AI Coding Killing Open Source?</title>
      <link>//localhost:1314/debates/open-source-impact.html</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-question&#34;&gt;The Question&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Open source software has been the bedrock of modern computing for decades. Linux runs the cloud, Apache and Nginx serve the web, React and Vue power the frontend, and tens of thousands of libraries form the invisible infrastructure of every application we use. The people who built and maintained this commons did so for a complex mix of reasons: personal satisfaction, reputation building, community belonging, and the belief that shared code makes everyone better off.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>OpenAI&#39;s cash burn will be one of the big bubble questions of 2026</title>
      <link>//localhost:1314/sources/2025-12-30-openai-cash-burn.html</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This Economist article examines the financial sustainability questions surrounding OpenAI and the broader AI industry heading into 2026. The piece focuses on OpenAI&amp;rsquo;s extraordinary capital requirements and whether the company&amp;rsquo;s spending trajectory can be justified by eventual revenue generation. The article could not be directly accessed due to the Economist&amp;rsquo;s paywall, but the extensive HN discussion provides substantial insight into the arguments.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The core question is whether AI companies &amp;ndash; particularly OpenAI &amp;ndash; can convert their massive capital expenditures into sustainable businesses. OpenAI&amp;rsquo;s fundraising trajectory and infrastructure spending plans have reached a scale that invites comparisons to historical technology bubbles. The company&amp;rsquo;s capital needs are staggering, and the question of whether AI adoption will translate into proportional revenue in the near term remains genuinely open.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

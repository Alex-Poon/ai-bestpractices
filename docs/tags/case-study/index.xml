      <title>Case Study: Building a C Compiler with AI Agents</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nicholas Carlini set out to answer a simple question: can you build real, production-grade software using nothing but parallel AI agents? The result was a 100,000-line Rust-based C compiler, produced by 16 parallel Claude instances over two weeks, that passed 99% of the GCC torture test suite and compiled the Linux 6.9 kernel across x86, ARM, and RISC-V architectures.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The compiler itself is impressive. But the lasting value of this experiment lies in what it revealed about how autonomous agents succeed and fail at scale &amp;ndash; and why the infrastructure surrounding the agents matters more than the agents themselves.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Case Study: Hashimoto&#39;s AI Adoption Journey</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mitchell Hashimoto &amp;ndash; co-founder of HashiCorp, creator of Vagrant, Terraform, and Consul &amp;ndash; published a detailed account of his personal journey adopting AI coding tools. The article resonated far beyond the usual AI discourse because Hashimoto is not a hype-prone commentator. He is a practitioner with decades of experience shipping infrastructure software used by millions of developers. When he says something works, the community pays attention.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;His account became a focal point for one of the most grounded Hacker News discussions on AI-assisted development, drawing dozens of experienced practitioners into a conversation about what actually works, what fails, and what remains genuinely uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Karpathy&#39;s AI Coding Notes: A Deep Reading</title>
      <link>//localhost:1314/evidence/karpathy-notes.html</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In late January 2026, Andrej Karpathy &amp;ndash; former director of AI at Tesla, founding member of OpenAI, and one of the most respected voices in machine learning &amp;ndash; shared a thread of observations from a week of intensive Claude Code usage. The post received 911 upvotes on Hacker News and generated over 800 comments, making it one of the most substantive community discussions on AI-assisted development in the corpus.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What made this discussion exceptional was not Karpathy&amp;rsquo;s observations alone, but the quality of the community response. His notes served as a catalyst for practitioners across the experience spectrum to articulate positions they had been forming through months of daily AI tool usage. The result is a uniquely rich snapshot of how the developer community was processing the AI-assisted coding transition in early 2026.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

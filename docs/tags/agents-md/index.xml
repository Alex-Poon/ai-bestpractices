      <description>&lt;p&gt;Harness engineering is the practice of building persistent infrastructure that constrains and guides AI agents across sessions. It is the highest-leverage investment in AI-assisted development because it compounds: every mistake you document is a mistake that never recurs, every custom tool you build saves time in every future session, and every test harness you configure raises the floor on output quality.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The harness is the answer to the fundamental limitation of current AI agents: they are stateless. Each session starts fresh with no memory of corrections, preferences, or past failures. The harness is the only mechanism that carries knowledge forward.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>AGENTS.md Outperforms Skills in Our Agent Evals</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Vercel&amp;rsquo;s engineering team published an evaluation comparing two approaches to providing AI coding agents with documentation: AGENTS.md files (passive context embedded in the system prompt) versus skills (active retrieval tools the agent can invoke on demand). The evaluation targeted Next.js 16 APIs that were absent from model training data, including new patterns like &lt;code&gt;&#39;use cache&#39;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;connection()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;forbidden()&lt;/code&gt;, and async &lt;code&gt;cookies()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The results were striking. A compressed 8KB documentation index embedded in AGENTS.md achieved a 100% pass rate on the evaluation tasks, while skills maxed out at 79% even with explicit instructions telling the agent to use them. Without explicit instructions, skills performed no better than the 53% baseline. The root cause was that in 56% of eval cases, the skill was never invoked at all — the agent simply failed to recognize when it needed documentation help.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

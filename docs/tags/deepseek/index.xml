      <title>Model Releases in 2026</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The first weeks of 2026 have seen an extraordinary density of model releases. The pace itself is informative: frontier model competition has intensified to the point where simultaneous launches are the norm rather than the exception. Here is what has shipped and what it means for practitioners.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;claude-opus-46-february-2026&#34;&gt;Claude Opus 4.6 (February 2026)&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anthropic&amp;rsquo;s latest flagship arrived with a 1M-token context window in beta &amp;mdash; the first at the Opus tier. Benchmark results placed it at the top of Terminal-Bench 2.0 for agentic coding and Humanity&amp;rsquo;s Last Exam for complex reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>DeepSeek kicks off 2026 with paper signalling push to train bigger models for less</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;DeepSeek published a technical paper at the start of 2026 introducing Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections (mHC), a novel approach to training AI models more cost-effectively. The paper was co-authored by founder Liang Wenfeng and represents the Chinese AI startup&amp;rsquo;s ongoing effort to compete with better-funded American competitors through efficiency innovations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The mHC technique builds upon ByteDance&amp;rsquo;s earlier hyper-connections concept but adds critical efficiency improvements. The core idea constrains the hyper-connection network using a specific manifold structure to ensure both compute and cost efficiency, addressing memory cost limitations in previous architectures. The researchers demonstrated that mHC enables stable large-scale training with superior scalability compared to conventional hyper-connections, and achieves these gains with negligible computational overhead.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

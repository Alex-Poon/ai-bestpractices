      <title>Stripe Minions – End to end agentic coding</title>
      <link>/sources/2026-02-10-stripe-minions-agentic-coding.html</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Stripe built a custom internal coding agent system called Minions that handles end-to-end task completion with no human involvement during execution. Over a thousand pull requests per week at Stripe are entirely produced by minions — no human-written code — though every PR still undergoes human review before merging. The system was purpose-built because off-the-shelf agentic tools could not handle Stripe&amp;rsquo;s unique constraints: a codebase spanning hundreds of millions of lines, specialized stacks including Ruby with Sorbet typing, hundreds of proprietary internal libraries unfamiliar to any pretrained model, and the operational stakes of code that processes over a trillion dollars in annual payment volume.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Agentic AI Handbook: Production-Ready Patterns</title>
      <link>/sources/2026-01-21-agentic-ai-handbook.html</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Agentic AI Handbook provides a comprehensive taxonomy of production-ready patterns for building agentic AI systems. Its core definition frames an agent as an LLM wrapped in a loop that can observe state, call tools, record results, and decide when it is done. The handbook organizes patterns into eight categories covering orchestration and control, tool use, context and memory, feedback loops, UX and collaboration, reliability and evaluation, learning and adaptation, and security and safety.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Agentic Frameworks in 2026: Less Hype, More Autonomy</title>
      <link>/sources/2026-01-06-agentic-frameworks-2026.html</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This HN text post by raghavchamadiya provides a practitioner-level comparison of agentic frameworks in 2026, focusing on lived behavior rather than benchmarks. The author has built, broken, and rebuilt agents across several stacks and shares observations on how the ecosystem has matured.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The core thesis is that the key differentiator for frameworks has shifted from how they wrap prompting and tool calls (the 2024 approach) to how they model time, memory, and failure. Agents that cannot reason over long horizons or learn from their own mistakes collapse under real workloads regardless of how clever the prompt engineering looks in demos.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

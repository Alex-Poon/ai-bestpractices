      <title>Claude Code Deep Dive</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Claude Code is Anthropic&amp;rsquo;s CLI-first coding agent. It runs in the terminal, takes natural language task descriptions, and executes autonomously &amp;ndash; reading files, running commands, editing code, and iterating on failures. It is single-model (Anthropic&amp;rsquo;s Claude family), available through Claude Max subscriptions at $100-200/month, and focused entirely on agentic workflows with no autocomplete mode.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What sets Claude Code apart from other agents is its extensibility. It supports CLAUDE.md project files, custom sub-agents, hooks for CI/CD integration, and MCP servers for structured tool access. This page covers the major features and developments that matter to practitioners.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Context Management</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Context management is the practice of working within and around the finite context window that constrains every AI agent interaction. It is the most technical of the core practices and the one that separates power users from frustrated ones. Most practical failures in agentic coding &amp;ndash; going in circles, forgetting instructions, losing coherence over long sessions &amp;ndash; trace back to context management problems.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The context window is not just a size limit. It is the agent&amp;rsquo;s entire working memory. Everything the agent knows about your project, your conversation, its instructions, and its tools must fit within this window. As it fills, quality degrades &amp;ndash; not gradually, but in ways that are hard to predict and hard to recover from.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Gemini CLI</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Gemini CLI is Google&amp;rsquo;s terminal-based coding agent, powered by Gemini models. It offers a similar interaction model to Claude Code &amp;ndash; describe a task in natural language, and the agent reads files, generates code, and iterates &amp;ndash; but draws on Google&amp;rsquo;s model family and ecosystem. It is notable for its generous free tier, massive context windows, a sophisticated memory system, an agent skills framework, and the polarized practitioner reception that consistently separates benchmark performance from real-world experience. As of February 2026, it is at v0.27.0 with rapid weekly releases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

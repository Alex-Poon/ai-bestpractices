      <title>GLM-5: Targeting complex systems engineering and long-horizon agentic tasks</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Zhipu AI (Z.ai) released GLM-5, an open-weight mixture-of-experts model with 744 billion total parameters and 40 billion active parameters, licensed under MIT. The model targets what Z.ai calls &amp;ldquo;agentic engineering&amp;rdquo; — complex, multi-stage systems tasks that require autonomous decomposition of requirements, long-horizon planning, and sustained context coherence across extended workflows.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;GLM-5 scales up from its predecessor GLM-4.7 (368B parameters) with pre-training expanded from 23 trillion to 28.5 trillion tokens. On agentic benchmarks like Vending Bench 2, it claims the top position among open-source models and approaches the performance of proprietary frontier models like Claude Opus 4.5 and GPT-5.2 on reasoning, coding, and long-horizon task execution.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Ask HN: 10 months since the Llama-4 release: what happened to Meta AI?</title>
      <link>/sources/2026-02-05-ask-hn-llama-4-meta.html</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An Ask HN post raised questions about the state of Meta&amp;rsquo;s AI efforts roughly 10 months after the Llama 4 release, which was widely considered a disappointment. The original poster noted that Meta&amp;rsquo;s API remained waitlist-only even after that long period, suggesting significant organizational or strategic problems.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The discussion paints a picture of a company that, despite enormous resources, has struggled to maintain momentum in the open-source AI space. Multiple commenters pointed to internal dysfunction and leadership issues as likely explanations rather than technical limitations. The consensus was that Meta has the financial and engineering resources to compete but may be hampered by organizational challenges at the executive level.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

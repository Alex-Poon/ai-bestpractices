      <description>&lt;p&gt;These are not people who dismiss AI coding tools without trying them. They are practitioners who have used the tools extensively and articulate specific, concrete concerns. Their critiques are grounded in real failures, not theoretical objections.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-craft-programmer&#34;&gt;The craft programmer&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ryandrake&lt;/strong&gt; got into programming because he enjoys programming &amp;ndash; the act of defining problems in data structures, the puzzle of finding elegant solutions. If he wanted to tell someone else how to do the work, he would have gone into management. AI tools remove the very thing that attracted him to the field.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>When It Fails</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;AI coding tools fail in characteristic ways. Not randomly &amp;ndash; in patterns that are recognizable, largely predictable, and often preventable if you know what to watch for. This page catalogs the major failure modes from practitioner experience. Some are technical limitations of current models. Some are emergent behaviors of how agents interact with codebases. Some are human failures amplified by the tools.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Understanding these failure modes is not pessimism. It is the practical knowledge that separates effective users from people who either over-trust or under-trust the tools. Every failure mode here has a corresponding mitigation, and most become manageable once you recognize them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

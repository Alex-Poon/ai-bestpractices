      <description>&lt;p&gt;Harness engineering is the practice of building persistent infrastructure that constrains and guides AI agents across sessions. It is the highest-leverage investment in AI-assisted development because it compounds: every mistake you document is a mistake that never recurs, every custom tool you build saves time in every future session, and every test harness you configure raises the floor on output quality.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The harness is the answer to the fundamental limitation of current AI agents: they are stateless. Each session starts fresh with no memory of corrections, preferences, or past failures. The harness is the only mechanism that carries knowledge forward.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

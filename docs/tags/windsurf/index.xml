      <description>&lt;p&gt;Windsurf is a full AI-native IDE built by Codeium. Unlike extensions that bolt AI onto existing editors, Windsurf was designed from the ground up around AI-first workflows. Its Cascade agent plans multi-step edits, calls tools, and maintains deep repository context. The tool positions itself as the primary alternative to Cursor, competing on context handling, pricing, and enterprise security features.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The core technical differentiator is context. Windsurf uses a RAG-based context engine that maintains an effective working context of approximately 200,000 tokens &amp;ndash; substantially larger than the practical context most other IDE-based agents achieve. This makes a meaningful difference on large codebases where the agent needs awareness of distant architectural decisions, shared types, and cross-module dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

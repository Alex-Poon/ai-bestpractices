      <title>Cursor</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cursor is a VS Code fork with AI capabilities built directly into the editor. It offers both autocomplete (Tab) and agentic (Composer/Agent) modes as first-class features, multi-model support with user-selectable models, and pricing starting at $20/month with usage-based tiers for heavier workloads. It has the largest adoption among AI coding tools in the IDE-first category.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-cursor-does-well&#34;&gt;What Cursor Does Well&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Low friction entry point.&lt;/strong&gt; Because Cursor is a VS Code fork, developers who already use VS Code can switch with minimal disruption. Extensions, keybindings, and settings transfer directly. This removes the adoption barrier that CLI-first tools face with developers unfamiliar with terminal workflows.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A few random notes from Claude coding quite a bit last week</title>
      <link>/sources/2026-01-26-karpathy-claude-coding-notes.html</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Andrej Karpathy shared a widely discussed thread of observations from extensive Claude Code usage. His notes touched on several key themes that resonated deeply with the developer community, generating nearly 100 HN comments and over 900 upvotes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of Karpathy&amp;rsquo;s central observations was around the tension between AI-assisted productivity and personal skill development. He noted that he was already experiencing atrophy in his ability to write code manually, finding it harder to recall syntax and implementation details. However, he argued this might be acceptable since code review skills remain intact even as writing fluency declines, drawing a parallel to how reading comprehension persists even when spelling ability degrades.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Obsidian meets Claude Code: A Markdown graph for agents and context</title>
      <link>/sources/2026-02-03-obsidian-claude-code.html</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Voicetree is an Electron-based desktop application that reimagines the development environment as a spatial graph where markdown notes and AI agent sessions coexist as interconnected nodes. The project merges Obsidian&amp;rsquo;s graph-view visualization paradigm with Claude Code&amp;rsquo;s agentic capabilities, addressing the growing challenge of managing multiple AI agent sessions and their outputs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The core innovation is a shared memory graph between the user and their agents. Rather than agents operating in isolated conversation histories, each agent node receives task content plus contextual information from nearby nodes in the graph. This spatial proximity model provides more targeted context retrieval than dumping entire conversation histories, which the creator claims avoids a documented performance degradation from context overload.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

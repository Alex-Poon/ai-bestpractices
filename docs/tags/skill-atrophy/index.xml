      <title>A few random notes from Claude coding quite a bit last week</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Andrej Karpathy shared a widely discussed thread of observations from extensive Claude Code usage. His notes touched on several key themes that resonated deeply with the developer community, generating nearly 100 HN comments and over 900 upvotes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of Karpathy&amp;rsquo;s central observations was around the tension between AI-assisted productivity and personal skill development. He noted that he was already experiencing atrophy in his ability to write code manually, finding it harder to recall syntax and implementation details. However, he argued this might be acceptable since code review skills remain intact even as writing fluency declines, drawing a parallel to how reading comprehension persists even when spelling ability degrades.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Verification: Reading AI-Generated Code</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As AI takes over more code generation, the developer&amp;rsquo;s primary contribution shifts from writing to reading. Verification &amp;ndash; the ability to evaluate whether AI-generated code is correct, secure, and aligned with intent &amp;ndash; becomes the skill that separates productive AI usage from expensive mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-verification-matters-more-than-generation&#34;&gt;Why Verification Matters More Than Generation&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The economics of AI-assisted development are asymmetric. Generating code is now cheap and fast. Deploying broken code is still expensive and slow to fix. The bottleneck has moved from production to quality control.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Open Questions</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Not everything about AI-assisted development is settled. Several major questions remain genuinely open, with credible evidence and strong opinions on multiple sides. This page captures the debates as they stand in early 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;is-ai-making-coding-skills-atrophy&#34;&gt;Is AI Making Coding Skills Atrophy?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anthropic&amp;rsquo;s own randomized controlled study provides the most rigorous data point. Junior developers using AI assistance scored 17% lower on comprehension quizzes &amp;mdash; a gap the researchers characterized as equivalent to nearly two letter grades, with the largest deficit appearing in debugging skills. The speed gains (roughly two minutes faster) were not statistically significant.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

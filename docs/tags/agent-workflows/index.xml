      <description>&lt;p&gt;Claude Code is Anthropic&amp;rsquo;s CLI-first coding agent. It runs in the terminal, takes natural language task descriptions, and executes autonomously &amp;ndash; reading files, running commands, editing code, and iterating on failures. It is single-model (Anthropic&amp;rsquo;s Claude family), available through Claude Max subscriptions at $100-200/month, and focused entirely on agentic workflows with no autocomplete mode.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What sets Claude Code apart from other agents is its extensibility. It supports CLAUDE.md project files, custom sub-agents, hooks for CI/CD integration, and MCP servers for structured tool access. This page covers the major features and developments that matter to practitioners.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Andrej Karpathy shared a widely discussed thread of observations from extensive Claude Code usage. His notes touched on several key themes that resonated deeply with the developer community, generating nearly 100 HN comments and over 900 upvotes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of Karpathy&amp;rsquo;s central observations was around the tension between AI-assisted productivity and personal skill development. He noted that he was already experiencing atrophy in his ability to write code manually, finding it harder to recall syntax and implementation details. However, he argued this might be acceptable since code review skills remain intact even as writing fluency declines, drawing a parallel to how reading comprehension persists even when spelling ability degrades.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Claude Code&#39;s New Hidden Feature: Swarms</title>
      <link>/sources/2026-01-24-claude-code-swarms.html</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A tweet by @NicerInPerson revealed that Claude Code contains hidden multi-agent orchestration capabilities, colloquially referred to as &amp;ldquo;swarms.&amp;rdquo; The discovery, corroborated by a GitHub repository (claude-sneakpeek by mikekelly), showed that Anthropic had built native sub-agent coordination features including a TeammateTool, delegate mode for spawning background agents, and a team coordination system with messaging and task ownership. Rather than relying on third-party orchestration frameworks, these capabilities are built directly into Claude Code but gated behind feature flags not yet available in general release.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Opus 4.5 is not the normal AI agent experience</title>
      <link>/sources/2026-01-06-opus-4-5-agent-experience.html</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Burke Holland wrote an enthusiastic account of his experience using Claude&amp;rsquo;s Opus 4.5 model, arguing it represents a fundamental shift in AI agent capabilities that goes beyond anything he had previously experienced. His central claim is that Opus 4.5 delivers on promises that earlier AI coding agents could not fulfill, particularly around autonomous problem-solving and first-attempt success rates.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Holland completed four substantial projects in rapid succession: an image conversion utility, a video editor, a social media automation app, and a route optimization tool. He highlighted the model&amp;rsquo;s ability to handle full-stack development spanning frontend, backend, authentication, database integration, and cloud infrastructure &amp;ndash; areas that had traditionally been weak points for AI agents.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Agentic AI Handbook: Production-Ready Patterns</title>
      <link>/sources/2026-01-21-agentic-ai-handbook.html</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Agentic AI Handbook provides a comprehensive taxonomy of production-ready patterns for building agentic AI systems. Its core definition frames an agent as an LLM wrapped in a loop that can observe state, call tools, record results, and decide when it is done. The handbook organizes patterns into eight categories covering orchestration and control, tool use, context and memory, feedback loops, UX and collaboration, reliability and evaluation, learning and adaptation, and security and safety.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cline is an open-source VS Code extension that turns large language models into autonomous coding agents. Originally released as &amp;ldquo;Claude Dev,&amp;rdquo; it has grown to over 5 million installs across VS Code, JetBrains, Cursor, and Windsurf. Its defining characteristic is a human-in-the-loop design: the agent proposes actions at every step and waits for your approval before executing. This makes it one of the most transparent and controllable AI coding tools available.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Coding with LLMs in 2026: The Model Matters More Than the Prompts</title>
      <link>/sources/2026-01-18-model-matters-more-than-prompts.html</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This post by @slow_developer on X (formerly Twitter) argues that the shift from 2025 to 2026 in AI-assisted coding has been defined by a fundamental rebalancing: model choice now outweighs prompt engineering as the primary lever for coding quality. Where 2025 workflows focused heavily on crafting precise prompts and structuring interactions carefully, the advancements in frontier models have made the underlying model capability the dominant factor in output quality.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Agentic Frameworks in 2026: Less Hype, More Autonomy</title>
      <link>/sources/2026-01-06-agentic-frameworks-2026.html</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This HN text post by raghavchamadiya provides a practitioner-level comparison of agentic frameworks in 2026, focusing on lived behavior rather than benchmarks. The author has built, broken, and rebuilt agents across several stacks and shares observations on how the ecosystem has matured.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The core thesis is that the key differentiator for frameworks has shifted from how they wrap prompting and tool calls (the 2024 approach) to how they model time, memory, and failure. Agents that cannot reason over long horizons or learn from their own mistakes collapse under real workloads regardless of how clever the prompt engineering looks in demos.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>LLM coding workflow going into 2026</title>
      <link>/sources/2026-01-10-llm-coding-workflow-2026.html</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/sources/2026-01-10-llm-coding-workflow-2026.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Addy Osmani, a well-known Google engineering leader, shared his comprehensive approach to integrating LLMs into daily coding workflows. The article frames LLMs not as autonomous coders but as powerful pair programmers requiring clear direction, context, and consistent oversight.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The workflow begins with collaborative planning, where the developer works with an AI to develop detailed specifications and project plans before writing code. Osmani describes this as achieving a traditional waterfall planning cycle compressed into roughly 15 minutes. Implementation then proceeds in small, iterative chunks sized to fit within context windows and remain comprehensible for human review.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Obsidian meets Claude Code: A Markdown graph for agents and context</title>
      <link>/sources/2026-02-03-obsidian-claude-code.html</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Voicetree is an Electron-based desktop application that reimagines the development environment as a spatial graph where markdown notes and AI agent sessions coexist as interconnected nodes. The project merges Obsidian&amp;rsquo;s graph-view visualization paradigm with Claude Code&amp;rsquo;s agentic capabilities, addressing the growing challenge of managing multiple AI agent sessions and their outputs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The core innovation is a shared memory graph between the user and their agents. Rather than agents operating in isolated conversation histories, each agent node receives task content plus contextual information from nearby nodes in the graph. This spatial proximity model provides more targeted context retrieval than dumping entire conversation histories, which the creator claims avoids a documented performance degradation from context overload.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>AI Coding Toolkit: Low-overhead workflow for reliable AI coding</title>
      <link>/sources/2026-01-22-ai-coding-toolkit.html</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/sources/2026-01-22-ai-coding-toolkit.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The AI Coding Toolkit is an open-source Git repository template designed to provide a structured yet lightweight workflow for semi-autonomous AI coding. The creator developed it after finding that existing AI coding workflows were either too complex (involving dozens of agents running in parallel) or too opinionated for the fast-moving AI coding landscape.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The toolkit operates through three sequential phases: Specify (a guided Q&amp;amp;A that captures requirements into product and technical specifications), Plan (automated generation of testable tasks with acceptance criteria), and Execute (AI agents complete tasks with built-in verification at each checkpoint). This structure enforces SDLC best practices while keeping the mental overhead low.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Klaus – a Claude Code native delegating agentic harness</title>
      <link>/sources/2026-01-25-klaus-agentic-harness.html</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/sources/2026-01-25-klaus-agentic-harness.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Klaus Baudelaire is an open-source agentic harness built entirely on top of Claude Code&amp;rsquo;s native features, designed to automate task delegation and agent routing without external APIs or services. The system addresses the overhead of manually deciding which agent configuration to use for a given prompt by implementing a keyword-based scoring algorithm that evaluates prompt complexity and routes tasks to the appropriate execution tier.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The core mechanism works through a single &lt;code&gt;UserPromptSubmit&lt;/code&gt; hook. When a user submits a prompt, Klaus analyzes it by assigning scores based on keyword complexity (terms like &amp;ldquo;system architecture&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;oauth&amp;rdquo; increase scores, while &amp;ldquo;fix typo&amp;rdquo; decreases them) and prompt length. The resulting score maps to one of four tiers: DIRECT (score 0-2, no agents needed for simple edits), LIGHT (3-4, single agent for basic features), MEDIUM (5-6, four agents for multi-file changes), and FULL (7+ for complex architecture requiring six agents).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Using AI coding tools effectively is not about writing better prompts on any given day. It is about building habits that compound over weeks and months. This page distills the daily routines that experienced practitioners follow, drawn from &lt;a href=&#34;../../sources/2026-01-26-karpathy-claude-coding-notes/&#34;&gt;Karpathy&amp;rsquo;s coding notes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;../../sources/2026-01-04-llm-coding-workflow-2026/&#34;&gt;Addy Osmani&amp;rsquo;s LLM workflow&lt;/a&gt;, and patterns observed across the broader practitioner community.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;morning-setup&#34;&gt;Morning Setup&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review your harness files.&lt;/strong&gt; Open your AGENTS.md or CLAUDE.md and scan for anything outdated. If you corrected the agent yesterday but did not document it, add the entry now. Remove rules that no longer apply. A stale harness teaches the agent outdated habits. See the &lt;a href=&#34;../../workflows/agents-md-guide/&#34;&gt;AGENTS.md Guide&lt;/a&gt; for maintenance discipline.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A few random notes from Claude coding quite a bit last week</title>
      <link>/sources/2026-01-26-karpathy-claude-coding-notes.html</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Andrej Karpathy shared a widely discussed thread of observations from extensive Claude Code usage. His notes touched on several key themes that resonated deeply with the developer community, generating nearly 100 HN comments and over 900 upvotes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of Karpathy&amp;rsquo;s central observations was around the tension between AI-assisted productivity and personal skill development. He noted that he was already experiencing atrophy in his ability to write code manually, finding it harder to recall syntax and implementation details. However, he argued this might be acceptable since code review skills remain intact even as writing fluency declines, drawing a parallel to how reading comprehension persists even when spelling ability degrades.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How AI assistance impacts the formation of coding skills</title>
      <link>/sources/2026-01-30-ai-assistance-coding-skills.html</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anthropic published a randomized controlled study examining how AI assistance affects skill acquisition among junior software engineers. The research involved 52 participants divided into AI-assisted and control groups, tasked with learning and using Trio (a Python asynchronous programming library). After completing coding tasks, participants took a comprehension quiz covering debugging, code reading, code writing, and conceptual understanding.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The results revealed a significant trade-off between speed and learning. The AI-assisted group scored 17% lower on the comprehension quiz, a gap the researchers characterized as equivalent to nearly two letter grades, with a large effect size (Cohen&amp;rsquo;s d of 0.738, p=0.01). The largest performance gap appeared on debugging questions, suggesting that AI assistance particularly impairs the development of error identification skills. Meanwhile, AI users finished tasks roughly two minutes faster on average, though this speed advantage was not statistically significant.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Vibe Coding Spectrum</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Vibe coding&amp;rdquo; entered the vocabulary in early 2025, but practitioners quickly discovered that the term covered fundamentally different activities. David Bau&amp;rsquo;s influential article identified two distinct types, and the community debate that followed revealed a full spectrum of approaches between them. Understanding where you are on this spectrum &amp;ndash; and where you should be &amp;ndash; is one of the most consequential workflow decisions in AI-assisted development.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-two-types&#34;&gt;The Two Types&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;David Bau drew a line between two modes that both get called &amp;ldquo;vibe coding&amp;rdquo; but require entirely different infrastructure and mindset.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

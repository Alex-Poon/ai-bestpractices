      <title>Stripe Minions – End to end agentic coding</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Stripe built a custom internal coding agent system called Minions that handles end-to-end task completion with no human involvement during execution. Over a thousand pull requests per week at Stripe are entirely produced by minions — no human-written code — though every PR still undergoes human review before merging. The system was purpose-built because off-the-shelf agentic tools could not handle Stripe&amp;rsquo;s unique constraints: a codebase spanning hundreds of millions of lines, specialized stacks including Ruby with Sorbet typing, hundreds of proprietary internal libraries unfamiliar to any pretrained model, and the operational stakes of code that processes over a trillion dollars in annual payment volume.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Windsurf is a full AI-native IDE built by Codeium. Unlike extensions that bolt AI onto existing editors, Windsurf was designed from the ground up around AI-first workflows. Its Cascade agent plans multi-step edits, calls tools, and maintains deep repository context. The tool positions itself as the primary alternative to Cursor, competing on context handling, pricing, and enterprise security features.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The core technical differentiator is context. Windsurf uses a RAG-based context engine that maintains an effective working context of approximately 200,000 tokens &amp;ndash; substantially larger than the practical context most other IDE-based agents achieve. This makes a meaningful difference on large codebases where the agent needs awareness of distant architectural decisions, shared types, and cross-module dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Kiro is AWS&amp;rsquo;s entry into the AI coding tool space. It went generally available in November 2025 and takes a fundamentally different approach from other AI IDEs: spec-driven development. Instead of starting with code and having AI assist along the way, Kiro starts with requirements described in natural language and produces user stories, technical design documents, coding task lists, and then code &amp;ndash; along with documentation and tests.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This positions Kiro as the anti-vibe-coding tool. Where most AI coding assistants optimize for speed and developer flow, Kiro optimizes for rigor and traceability. Requirements link to specs, specs link to code, code links to tests. The entire chain is auditable, which appeals to organizations that need to demonstrate compliance or maintain strict engineering standards.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

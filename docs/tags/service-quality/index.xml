      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This HN text post by shikkra documents reliability concerns with Anthropic&amp;rsquo;s Claude service, providing a detailed incident count from the official status page (status.claude.com). The author, a $100/month Max plan subscriber, was prompted to investigate after encountering a retry issue where Claude attempted to generate a response 10 times with Opus 4.5 and extended thinking enabled before silently switching to a different model without indication or confirmation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The incident data paints a concerning picture of service reliability. February 2026 had 10 incidents in just 4 days. January 2026 had 26 incidents. December 2025 had 21 incidents. At least 16 of these directly affected Claude Opus 4.5: 3 incidents in December (21-23), 9 in January (across 7-28), and 4 in February (1-4). Ten additional incidents affected the claude.ai platform itself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

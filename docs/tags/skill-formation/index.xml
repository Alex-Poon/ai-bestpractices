      <title>Does AI Prevent Junior Developer Skill Formation?</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-question&#34;&gt;The Question&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In early 2026, Anthropic published a study on AI-assisted coding that confirmed what many practitioners already suspected: developers using AI tools showed impaired conceptual understanding and weaker debugging skills compared to those who struggled through problems manually. The study landed in a community already anxious about what AI means for the next generation of programmers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The implications are profound. If AI tools prevent junior developers from forming the deep skills that senior developers rely on, the industry faces a compounding problem. Today&amp;rsquo;s juniors become tomorrow&amp;rsquo;s seniors. If they never develop the judgment to direct and verify AI output, who reviews the code? Who diagnoses production failures? Who makes architectural decisions that AI can&amp;rsquo;t yet make well?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

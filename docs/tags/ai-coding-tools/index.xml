      <title>AI coding assistants are getting worse?</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This IEEE Spectrum article by Jamie Twiss presents the provocative claim that AI coding assistants are experiencing degradation rather than improvement. The central narrative comes from power users who report that these tools have hit a plateau, with some even declining in capability. The article identifies what it calls &amp;ldquo;silent failures&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; situations where AI coding tools appear functional on the surface but are actually underperforming in subtle, hard-to-detect ways.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>2026: The Year the IDE Died (Steve Yegge and Gene Kim)</title>
      <link>/sources/2025-12-10-year-ide-died.html</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This HN submission links to a YouTube talk by Steve Yegge and Gene Kim exploring how AI coding tools might replace the traditional IDE as the primary programming environment. The submitter (mikebiglan) frames the discussion around several key questions: how far IDEs will change, whether developers will still read and reason about code directly, and what the shift means for both senior developers and students entering the field.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The talk argues that what we think of as the IDE today will not remain the primary programming tool of the future. The vision includes modularity and swarms of agents working in parallel, with context windows as a key architectural constraint. The speakers suggest that the transition is already underway, with AI-first and workflow-first environments replacing file-and-buffer-first approaches.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

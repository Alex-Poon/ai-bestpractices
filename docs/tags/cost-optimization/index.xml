      <description>&lt;p&gt;AI coding tools promise productivity gains, but they come with real costs &amp;mdash; financial, operational, and strategic. This page collects what practitioners have reported spending, the reliability challenges they face, and the economic questions that remain unresolved.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-638-study-what-heavy-usage-actually-costs&#34;&gt;The $638 Study: What Heavy Usage Actually Costs&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the most detailed cost reports comes from a founder and CTO who tracked AI coding expenses over six weeks. The total: $638 in on-demand charges using Cursor with Claude models, with October 2025 alone hitting $348 and reaching Cursor&amp;rsquo;s $400 monthly limit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Model Selection</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Model selection is the skill of matching the right model to the right task. The gap between a well-chosen and poorly-chosen model often matters more than the quality of the prompt itself. As models proliferate and differentiate, this is no longer a set-and-forget decision &amp;ndash; it is an ongoing practice of matching capability to need.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-model-selection-is&#34;&gt;What Model Selection Is&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Model selection means choosing which AI model (or combination of models) to use for a specific task, based on the task&amp;rsquo;s complexity, error tolerance, speed requirements, and cost constraints. It also means knowing when to switch models mid-task, when to use multiple models for cross-validation, and when to escalate from a cheap model to an expensive one.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>I spent $638 on AI coding agents in 6 weeks</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A founder and CTO building an AI-first CRM product shared a detailed breakdown of their AI coding costs, revealing surprisingly high expenses from using Cursor with Claude models. Over a six-week period spanning October and November 2025, the author accumulated $638 in on-demand charges, with October alone costing $348.56 and hitting Cursor&amp;rsquo;s $400 limit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The cost analysis revealed that Claude 4.5 Sonnet Thinking requests ranged from $0.02 to $0.06 depending on context size, which seemed modest per-request but compounded rapidly at 200+ daily requests. The author experimented with 7 different models (GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Cheetah, and others) but found Claude consumed 85% of the budget because it consistently produced the best results.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Claude Code gets native LSP support</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anthropic added native Language Server Protocol (LSP) support to Claude Code, enabling the CLI-based agent to integrate with language servers for improved code understanding, navigation, and analysis. The feature was announced through Claude Code&amp;rsquo;s changelog and surfaced via a plugin system where users can discover and install LSP integrations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;LSP support represents a significant step in making CLI-based AI coding agents competitive with IDE-based tools like Cursor. Language servers provide structured information about code: type definitions, references, diagnostics, and refactoring capabilities. By connecting Claude Code to these servers, the agent gains access to the same code intelligence that powers IDE features, without requiring a full IDE environment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>2026: The Year the IDE Died (Steve Yegge and Gene Kim)</title>
      <link>/sources/2025-12-10-year-ide-died.html</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This HN submission links to a YouTube talk by Steve Yegge and Gene Kim exploring how AI coding tools might replace the traditional IDE as the primary programming environment. The submitter (mikebiglan) frames the discussion around several key questions: how far IDEs will change, whether developers will still read and reason about code directly, and what the shift means for both senior developers and students entering the field.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The talk argues that what we think of as the IDE today will not remain the primary programming tool of the future. The vision includes modularity and swarms of agents working in parallel, with context windows as a key architectural constraint. The speakers suggest that the transition is already underway, with AI-first and workflow-first environments replacing file-and-buffer-first approaches.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

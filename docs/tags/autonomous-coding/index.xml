      <title>Stripe Minions – End to end agentic coding</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Stripe built a custom internal coding agent system called Minions that handles end-to-end task completion with no human involvement during execution. Over a thousand pull requests per week at Stripe are entirely produced by minions — no human-written code — though every PR still undergoes human review before merging. The system was purpose-built because off-the-shelf agentic tools could not handle Stripe&amp;rsquo;s unique constraints: a codebase spanning hundreds of millions of lines, specialized stacks including Ruby with Sorbet typing, hundreds of proprietary internal libraries unfamiliar to any pretrained model, and the operational stakes of code that processes over a trillion dollars in annual payment volume.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Case Study: Building a C Compiler with AI Agents</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nicholas Carlini set out to answer a simple question: can you build real, production-grade software using nothing but parallel AI agents? The result was a 100,000-line Rust-based C compiler, produced by 16 parallel Claude instances over two weeks, that passed 99% of the GCC torture test suite and compiled the Linux 6.9 kernel across x86, ARM, and RISC-V architectures.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The compiler itself is impressive. But the lasting value of this experiment lies in what it revealed about how autonomous agents succeed and fail at scale &amp;ndash; and why the infrastructure surrounding the agents matters more than the agents themselves.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

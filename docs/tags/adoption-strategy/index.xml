      <title>Case Study: Hashimoto&#39;s AI Adoption Journey</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mitchell Hashimoto &amp;ndash; co-founder of HashiCorp, creator of Vagrant, Terraform, and Consul &amp;ndash; published a detailed account of his personal journey adopting AI coding tools. The article resonated far beyond the usual AI discourse because Hashimoto is not a hype-prone commentator. He is a practitioner with decades of experience shipping infrastructure software used by millions of developers. When he says something works, the community pays attention.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;His account became a focal point for one of the most grounded Hacker News discussions on AI-assisted development, drawing dozens of experienced practitioners into a conversation about what actually works, what fails, and what remains genuinely uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Adoption Curve</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;AI-assisted development in early 2026 is past the novelty phase but far from universal. The community is split, the data is mixed, and where a given developer lands depends as much on their workflow and identity as on the technology itself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-six-stages-framework&#34;&gt;The Six Stages Framework&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;../../guides/adoption-stages/&#34;&gt;Six Stages of AI Adoption&lt;/a&gt; framework, synthesized from Mitchell Hashimoto&amp;rsquo;s influential account and extensive practitioner discussion, describes a progression from chatbot usage through always-running agents. It remains the best map of the adoption journey because each stage builds on the calibration and infrastructure of the previous one.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Adoption Curve: Where Are You?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Developers who successfully adopt AI coding agents tend to follow the same progression. Not because someone prescribed it, but because each stage builds the calibration and infrastructure the next stage requires. Skipping stages leads to frustration, wasted money, and the conclusion that agents do not work &amp;mdash; when the real problem was missing foundations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This framework synthesizes Mitchell Hashimoto&amp;rsquo;s adoption journey with findings from practitioner experience, Anthropic&amp;rsquo;s research on skill formation, and community cost data. Most developers who abandon AI-assisted development stall between Stages 1 and 2. Most who succeed credit the investments they made in Stages 2 and 5.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

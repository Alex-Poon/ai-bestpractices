      <title>The Six Stages of AI Adoption</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Developers who successfully adopt AI coding agents tend to follow the same progression. Not because someone prescribed it, but because each stage builds the calibration and infrastructure required by the next. Skipping stages leads to frustration, wasted effort, and the conclusion that agents do not work &amp;mdash; when the real problem was missing foundations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This framework synthesizes practitioner experience into six stages. Most developers who abandon AI-assisted development get stuck between Stages 1 and 2. Most developers who succeed credit the investments made in Stages 2 and 5.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What Practitioners Actually Think About AI Coding</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Hacker News discussion around Mitchell Hashimoto&amp;rsquo;s AI adoption article drew dozens of experienced practitioners into a remarkably grounded conversation about what actually works, what fails, and what remains genuinely uncertain about AI-assisted development. Unlike most online AI discourse, this thread was dominated by people sharing concrete experiences rather than abstract positions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What follows is a synthesis of where this community of practitioners has converged &amp;ndash; and where honest disagreement remains.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

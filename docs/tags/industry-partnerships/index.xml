      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Apple announced a partnership with Google to use Gemini as the foundational AI technology powering Siri, marking one of the most significant strategic moves in the AI industry. The deal, reportedly valued near $1 billion, represents Apple&amp;rsquo;s acknowledgment that building competitive frontier AI models in-house is not where their advantage lies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Apple&amp;rsquo;s decision was driven by several practical realities. Despite having world-class edge inference silicon through their Neural Engine, Apple has effectively zero presence in training datacenters &amp;ndash; lacking the TPU pods or GPU clusters needed to train frontier models from scratch. Google, by contrast, has deep pockets, enterprise infrastructure experience, and diversified revenue streams that make them a stable long-term partner.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-question&#34;&gt;The Question&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Open source software has been the bedrock of modern computing for decades. Linux runs the cloud, Apache and Nginx serve the web, React and Vue power the frontend, and tens of thousands of libraries form the invisible infrastructure of every application we use. The people who built and maintained this commons did so for a complex mix of reasons: personal satisfaction, reputation building, community belonging, and the belief that shared code makes everyone better off.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Aider is an open-source, terminal-based AI pair programming tool released under the MIT license. It operates through a chat interface where you describe changes in natural language and Aider edits files directly, staging and committing them with descriptive messages. It represents the fully open alternative to proprietary CLI agents like Claude Code and Codex CLI &amp;ndash; you bring your own API keys, choose your own models, and pay nothing beyond inference costs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cline is an open-source VS Code extension that turns large language models into autonomous coding agents. Originally released as &amp;ldquo;Claude Dev,&amp;rdquo; it has grown to over 5 million installs across VS Code, JetBrains, Cursor, and Windsurf. Its defining characteristic is a human-in-the-loop design: the agent proposes actions at every step and waits for your approval before executing. This makes it one of the most transparent and controllable AI coding tools available.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How Vibe Coding Is Killing Open Source</title>
      <link>/sources/2026-02-02-vibe-coding-killing-open-source.html</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This Hackaday article reports on research examining how vibe coding — using LLM chatbots to generate code — creates systemic problems for open source projects. The core argument is that AI-mediated coding disrupts the traditional feedback loops between developers and open source communities in several damaging ways.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, developer engagement shifts away from open source communities entirely. Instead of visiting project websites, consulting documentation, or participating in forums, users interact exclusively with chatbots, eliminating opportunities for sponsorships, bug reports, and community building. Second, LLMs introduce library selection bias by favoring dependencies most prevalent in their training data rather than promoting merit-based adoption, concentrating usage around already-popular projects while marginalizing smaller initiatives. Third, a quality control crisis emerges because LLMs will not interact with library developers, submit usable bug reports, or be aware of potential issues.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

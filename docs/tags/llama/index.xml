      <description>&lt;p&gt;The first weeks of 2026 have seen an extraordinary density of model releases. The pace itself is informative: frontier model competition has intensified to the point where simultaneous launches are the norm rather than the exception. Here is what has shipped and what it means for practitioners.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;claude-opus-46-february-2026&#34;&gt;Claude Opus 4.6 (February 2026)&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anthropic&amp;rsquo;s latest flagship arrived with a 1M-token context window in beta &amp;mdash; the first at the Opus tier. Benchmark results placed it at the top of Terminal-Bench 2.0 for agentic coding and Humanity&amp;rsquo;s Last Exam for complex reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Ask HN: 10 months since the Llama-4 release: what happened to Meta AI?</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An Ask HN post raised questions about the state of Meta&amp;rsquo;s AI efforts roughly 10 months after the Llama 4 release, which was widely considered a disappointment. The original poster noted that Meta&amp;rsquo;s API remained waitlist-only even after that long period, suggesting significant organizational or strategic problems.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The discussion paints a picture of a company that, despite enormous resources, has struggled to maintain momentum in the open-source AI space. Multiple commenters pointed to internal dysfunction and leadership issues as likely explanations rather than technical limitations. The consensus was that Meta has the financial and engineering resources to compete but may be hampered by organizational challenges at the executive level.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

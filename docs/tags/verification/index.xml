      <title>Beyond agentic coding</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This article takes a contrarian position within the AI-assisted development space: rather than celebrating autonomous coding agents, the author argues they fundamentally disrupt the developer flow state and proposes alternative paradigms inspired by &amp;ldquo;calm technology&amp;rdquo; principles. The core thesis is that chat-based agentic interfaces are indirect, slow, and imprecise &amp;ndash; and that the industry should explore AI tools that keep developers close to their code instead of mediating through conversation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Verification is the skill that makes every other AI-assisted development practice work. Task scoping, harness engineering, and model selection all ultimately exist to make verification easier and faster. If you cannot verify the output, nothing else matters.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The shift is fundamental: as AI takes over code generation, the developer&amp;rsquo;s primary contribution moves from writing to reading, reviewing, and validating. You are no longer the author. You are the editor &amp;ndash; and the editor must be a genuinely skilled reader, not a rubber stamp.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

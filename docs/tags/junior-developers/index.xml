      <title>Does AI Prevent Junior Developer Skill Formation?</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-question&#34;&gt;The Question&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In early 2026, Anthropic published a study on AI-assisted coding that confirmed what many practitioners already suspected: developers using AI tools showed impaired conceptual understanding and weaker debugging skills compared to those who struggled through problems manually. The study landed in a community already anxious about what AI means for the next generation of programmers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The implications are profound. If AI tools prevent junior developers from forming the deep skills that senior developers rely on, the industry faces a compounding problem. Today&amp;rsquo;s juniors become tomorrow&amp;rsquo;s seniors. If they never develop the judgment to direct and verify AI output, who reviews the code? Who diagnoses production failures? Who makes architectural decisions that AI can&amp;rsquo;t yet make well?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anthropic published a randomized controlled study examining how AI assistance affects skill acquisition among junior software engineers. The research involved 52 participants divided into AI-assisted and control groups, tasked with learning and using Trio (a Python asynchronous programming library). After completing coding tasks, participants took a comprehension quiz covering debugging, code reading, code writing, and conceptual understanding.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The results revealed a significant trade-off between speed and learning. The AI-assisted group scored 17% lower on the comprehension quiz, a gap the researchers characterized as equivalent to nearly two letter grades, with a large effect size (Cohen&amp;rsquo;s d of 0.738, p=0.01). The largest performance gap appeared on debugging questions, suggesting that AI assistance particularly impairs the development of error identification skills. Meanwhile, AI users finished tasks roughly two minutes faster on average, though this speed advantage was not statistically significant.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

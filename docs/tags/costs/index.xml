      <title>Model Deep Dive</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;../../practices/model-selection.html&#34;&gt;model selection&lt;/a&gt; practice page covers the principles: start cheap, escalate on failure, use multiple models, ignore benchmarks in favor of your own workload. This page is the complement &amp;ndash; a deep look at specific models, how they compare in real-world usage, and what they actually cost when practitioners put them to work.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The data here comes from two sources: Amp Code&amp;rsquo;s published model evaluation data (including their distinctive &amp;ldquo;off-the-rails&amp;rdquo; metric), and practitioner reports from over 6,000 Hacker News comments across 20+ discussion threads.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Real Cost of AI Coding Tools</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;AI coding tools are not free. Despite the productivity narratives, few adoption stories include a line item for what the tools actually cost. This page aggregates the cost data that practitioners have shared &amp;ndash; from individual developer spending to enterprise claims to the macro-economic forces reshaping AI pricing &amp;ndash; to give a grounded picture of the economics of AI-assisted development in early 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-individual-developers-actually-spend&#34;&gt;What individual developers actually spend&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The most detailed public cost breakdown comes from a founder and CTO building an AI-first CRM, who tracked every dollar across six weeks of heavy Cursor usage in late 2025. The total: $638 in on-demand charges, with October alone hitting $348.56. A follow-up analysis extended the picture to $928.45 over 70 days &amp;ndash; roughly $400 per month.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Is the AI Coding Tool Economy Sustainable?</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-question&#34;&gt;The Question&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The AI coding tool economy in early 2026 runs on a contradiction: developers are addicted to tools whose providers are hemorrhaging cash. OpenAI projects billions in losses, Anthropic burns through venture capital to subsidize Claude Code subscriptions, and Google treats Gemini as a loss leader to protect search revenue. Developers pay $20 to $200 per month for tools that consume far more in compute than those subscriptions cover.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Stripe Minions – End to end agentic coding</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Stripe built a custom internal coding agent system called Minions that handles end-to-end task completion with no human involvement during execution. Over a thousand pull requests per week at Stripe are entirely produced by minions — no human-written code — though every PR still undergoes human review before merging. The system was purpose-built because off-the-shelf agentic tools could not handle Stripe&amp;rsquo;s unique constraints: a codebase spanning hundreds of millions of lines, specialized stacks including Ruby with Sorbet typing, hundreds of proprietary internal libraries unfamiliar to any pretrained model, and the operational stakes of code that processes over a trillion dollars in annual payment volume.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How to Code Claude Code in 200 Lines of Code</title>
      <link>/sources/2026-01-08-claude-code-200-lines.html</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mihail Eric&amp;rsquo;s article, provocatively titled &amp;ldquo;The Emperor Has No Clothes,&amp;rdquo; argues that AI coding assistants are not magical — they follow a simple architectural loop. The user sends a request, the LLM decides which tools to call, your code executes those tools locally, and the results flow back to the LLM for context. The critical mental model is that the LLM never actually touches your filesystem; it asks for things to happen, and your code makes them happen.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

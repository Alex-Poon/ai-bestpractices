      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;DeepSeek published a technical paper at the start of 2026 introducing Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections (mHC), a novel approach to training AI models more cost-effectively. The paper was co-authored by founder Liang Wenfeng and represents the Chinese AI startup&amp;rsquo;s ongoing effort to compete with better-funded American competitors through efficiency innovations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The mHC technique builds upon ByteDance&amp;rsquo;s earlier hyper-connections concept but adds critical efficiency improvements. The core idea constrains the hyper-connection network using a specific manifold structure to ensure both compute and cost efficiency, addressing memory cost limitations in previous architectures. The researchers demonstrated that mHC enables stable large-scale training with superior scalability compared to conventional hyper-connections, and achieves these gains with negligible computational overhead.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

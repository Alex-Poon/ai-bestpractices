      <title>The Real Cost of AI Coding Tools</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;AI coding tools are not free. Despite the productivity narratives, few adoption stories include a line item for what the tools actually cost. This page aggregates the cost data that practitioners have shared &amp;ndash; from individual developer spending to enterprise claims to the macro-economic forces reshaping AI pricing &amp;ndash; to give a grounded picture of the economics of AI-assisted development in early 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-individual-developers-actually-spend&#34;&gt;What individual developers actually spend&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The most detailed public cost breakdown comes from a founder and CTO building an AI-first CRM, who tracked every dollar across six weeks of heavy Cursor usage in late 2025. The total: $638 in on-demand charges, with October alone hitting $348.56. A follow-up analysis extended the picture to $928.45 over 70 days &amp;ndash; roughly $400 per month.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Is the AI Coding Tool Economy Sustainable?</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-question&#34;&gt;The Question&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The AI coding tool economy in early 2026 runs on a contradiction: developers are addicted to tools whose providers are hemorrhaging cash. OpenAI projects billions in losses, Anthropic burns through venture capital to subsidize Claude Code subscriptions, and Google treats Gemini as a loss leader to protect search revenue. Developers pay $20 to $200 per month for tools that consume far more in compute than those subscriptions cover.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>OpenAI&#39;s cash burn will be one of the big bubble questions of 2026</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This Economist article examines the financial sustainability questions surrounding OpenAI and the broader AI industry heading into 2026. The piece focuses on OpenAI&amp;rsquo;s extraordinary capital requirements and whether the company&amp;rsquo;s spending trajectory can be justified by eventual revenue generation. The article could not be directly accessed due to the Economist&amp;rsquo;s paywall, but the extensive HN discussion provides substantial insight into the arguments.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The core question is whether AI companies &amp;ndash; particularly OpenAI &amp;ndash; can convert their massive capital expenditures into sustainable businesses. OpenAI&amp;rsquo;s fundraising trajectory and infrastructure spending plans have reached a scale that invites comparisons to historical technology bubbles. The company&amp;rsquo;s capital needs are staggering, and the question of whether AI adoption will translate into proportional revenue in the near term remains genuinely open.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How the AI Bubble Bursts in 2026</title>
      <link>/sources/2026-01-19-ai-bubble-bursts-2026.html</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This article from the &amp;ldquo;Where&amp;rsquo;s Your Ed At&amp;rdquo; newsletter by Ed Zitron presents a detailed case for how the AI bubble might collapse in 2026. The analysis focuses on three interconnected pressure points: OpenAI&amp;rsquo;s cash crisis, data center financing difficulties, and delayed infrastructure rollouts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the financial side, the article argues that OpenAI lacks sufficient capital to fund its massive infrastructure ambitions. It cites examples like Disney&amp;rsquo;s licensing deal being paid entirely in stock warrants rather than cash, and Amazon investing $10 billion into OpenAI so that OpenAI can pay AWS back &amp;ndash; a circular arrangement that highlights the company&amp;rsquo;s capital constraints.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

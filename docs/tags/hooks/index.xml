      <description>&lt;p&gt;Claude Code is Anthropic&amp;rsquo;s CLI-first coding agent. It runs in the terminal, takes natural language task descriptions, and executes autonomously &amp;ndash; reading files, running commands, editing code, and iterating on failures. It is single-model (Anthropic&amp;rsquo;s Claude family), available through Claude Max subscriptions at $100-200/month, and focused entirely on agentic workflows with no autocomplete mode.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What sets Claude Code apart from other agents is its extensibility. It supports CLAUDE.md project files, custom sub-agents, hooks for CI/CD integration, and MCP servers for structured tool access. This page covers the major features and developments that matter to practitioners.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Harness engineering is the practice of building persistent infrastructure that constrains and guides AI agents across sessions. It is the highest-leverage investment in AI-assisted development because it compounds: every mistake you document is a mistake that never recurs, every custom tool you build saves time in every future session, and every test harness you configure raises the floor on output quality.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The harness is the answer to the fundamental limitation of current AI agents: they are stateless. Each session starts fresh with no memory of corrections, preferences, or past failures. The harness is the only mechanism that carries knowledge forward.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

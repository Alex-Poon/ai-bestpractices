      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A founder and CTO building an AI-first CRM product shared a detailed breakdown of their AI coding costs, revealing surprisingly high expenses from using Cursor with Claude models. Over a six-week period spanning October and November 2025, the author accumulated $638 in on-demand charges, with October alone costing $348.56 and hitting Cursor&amp;rsquo;s $400 limit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The cost analysis revealed that Claude 4.5 Sonnet Thinking requests ranged from $0.02 to $0.06 depending on context size, which seemed modest per-request but compounded rapidly at 200+ daily requests. The author experimented with 7 different models (GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Cheetah, and others) but found Claude consumed 85% of the budget because it consistently produced the best results.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

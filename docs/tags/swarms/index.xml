      <title>Claude Code&#39;s New Hidden Feature: Swarms</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A tweet by @NicerInPerson revealed that Claude Code contains hidden multi-agent orchestration capabilities, colloquially referred to as &amp;ldquo;swarms.&amp;rdquo; The discovery, corroborated by a GitHub repository (claude-sneakpeek by mikekelly), showed that Anthropic had built native sub-agent coordination features including a TeammateTool, delegate mode for spawning background agents, and a team coordination system with messaging and task ownership. Rather than relying on third-party orchestration frameworks, these capabilities are built directly into Claude Code but gated behind feature flags not yet available in general release.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Patterns</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Multi-agent patterns involve running multiple AI agents simultaneously on related tasks. They represent the highest-throughput mode of AI-assisted development &amp;ndash; and the most complex. When they work, months of work happen in minutes. When they fail, you get merge conflicts, duplicated effort, and code that no single agent (or human) fully understands.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The practice is still emerging. There is no consensus on when multi-agent is worth the overhead versus well-scoped single-agent work. But practitioners are converging on principles that separate productive multi-agent usage from expensive chaos.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

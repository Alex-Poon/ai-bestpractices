      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A tweet by @NicerInPerson revealed that Claude Code contains hidden multi-agent orchestration capabilities, colloquially referred to as &amp;ldquo;swarms.&amp;rdquo; The discovery, corroborated by a GitHub repository (claude-sneakpeek by mikekelly), showed that Anthropic had built native sub-agent coordination features including a TeammateTool, delegate mode for spawning background agents, and a team coordination system with messaging and task ownership. Rather than relying on third-party orchestration frameworks, these capabilities are built directly into Claude Code but gated behind feature flags not yet available in general release.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

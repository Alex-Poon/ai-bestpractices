        <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>The Agentic AI Handbook provides a comprehensive taxonomy of production-ready patterns for building agentic AI systems. Its core definition frames an agent as an LLM wrapped in a loop that can observe state, call tools, record results, and decide when it is done. The handbook organizes patterns into eight categories covering orchestration and control, tool use, context and memory, feedback loops, UX and collaboration, reliability and evaluation, learning and adaptation, and security and safety.</p>
<p>Four foundational patterns anchor the framework. Plan-Then-Execute splits work into a planning phase, controlled execution, and replan gates with human review and policy controls. Inversion of Control provides clear goals and constraints while letting agents choose their own execution paths. The Reflection Loop anchors iterations to objective signals like tests, lints, or validation rather than subjective self-assessment. Action Trace Monitoring tracks observable behaviors such as tool calls, diffs, and test output with explicit kill switches for safety.</p>
<p>The handbook emphasizes practical production realities: adopt diff-first workflows, keep tasks small and bounded, create persistent project rules documents (covering test commands, constraints, and style guidelines), and avoid what it calls the &ldquo;Ralph Wiggum drift trap&rdquo; through tight scope and explicit checks. On security, it recommends removing at least one element from the &ldquo;lethal trifecta&rdquo; of private data access, untrusted input exposure, and external exfiltration capability. Multi-agent systems should be reserved for cleanly decomposable work with deterministic merging.</p>
<p>The overarching message is that agents multiply both output and mistakes. The bottleneck remains human judgment, and success requires deterministic checks, architectural oversight, and small PR sizes to prevent what the handbook terms &ldquo;slop gravity.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="key-insights">Key Insights</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Plan-Then-Execute prevents mid-execution drift</strong>: Splitting work into planning, execution, and replan gates with human review improves reliability</li>
<li><strong>Reflection loops need objective anchors</strong>: Self-assessment is unreliable; anchor iterations to tests, lints, and validation</li>
<li><strong>The lethal trifecta for security</strong>: Remove at least one of private data access, untrusted input exposure, or external exfiltration capability</li>
<li><strong>Small PRs prevent slop gravity</strong>: Agents produce volume; keeping changes small and reviewable prevents accumulated low-quality code</li>
<li><strong>Diff-first workflow</strong>: Focusing on diffs rather than complete file outputs keeps changes auditable and manageable</li>
<li><strong>Multi-agent systems require clean decomposition</strong>: Only use multiple agents when work decomposes cleanly with deterministic merging</li>
</ul>

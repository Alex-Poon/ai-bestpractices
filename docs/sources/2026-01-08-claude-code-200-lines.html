        <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Mihail Eric&rsquo;s article, provocatively titled &ldquo;The Emperor Has No Clothes,&rdquo; argues that AI coding assistants are not magical — they follow a simple architectural loop. The user sends a request, the LLM decides which tools to call, your code executes those tools locally, and the results flow back to the LLM for context. The critical mental model is that the LLM never actually touches your filesystem; it asks for things to happen, and your code makes them happen.</p>
<p>The author demonstrates that only three fundamental tools are sufficient for a functional coding agent: read files (examine code), list files (navigate projects), and edit files (create and modify). The implementation uses a straightforward tool registry where functions are registered with detailed docstrings that the LLM uses to reason about which tools to deploy. Communication uses structured calls in a defined format rather than direct file manipulation, keeping concerns separated.</p>
<p>The architecture centers on a conversation loop that enables tool chaining — the agent reads a file, edits it based on the content, then confirms the result, all within a single user request. Tool descriptions are generated from function signatures and docstrings, reducing maintenance overhead. Dynamic tool registration makes the system extensible.</p>
<p>The article acknowledges that production implementations add significant complexity: error handling, streaming responses, context management, additional tools (bash, grep, web search), and approval workflows. But the core loop — the fundamental architecture — remains identical to this simple 200-line version. The piece serves to demystify what coding agents actually do, lowering the barrier to building custom agents and understanding the limitations of existing ones.</p>
<h2 id="key-insights">Key Insights</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>The core loop is simple</strong>: User request, LLM tool selection, local execution, results back to LLM — this is the entire architecture</li>
<li><strong>Three tools suffice</strong>: Read files, list files, and edit files are enough for a functional coding agent</li>
<li><strong>LLMs never touch your filesystem</strong>: They request actions; your code executes them — understanding this separation is key</li>
<li><strong>Production complexity is in the scaffolding</strong>: Error handling, streaming, context management, approval workflows, and additional tools are what distinguish production agents from the core loop</li>
<li><strong>Tool descriptions drive behavior</strong>: Detailed docstrings on registered tools are how the LLM reasons about what to use and when</li>
<li><strong>Demystification enables customization</strong>: Understanding the simple core makes it practical to build custom agents for specific workflows</li>
</ul>

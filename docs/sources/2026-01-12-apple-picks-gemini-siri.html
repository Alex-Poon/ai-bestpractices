        <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Apple announced a partnership with Google to use Gemini as the foundational AI technology powering Siri, marking one of the most significant strategic moves in the AI industry. The deal, reportedly valued near $1 billion, represents Apple&rsquo;s acknowledgment that building competitive frontier AI models in-house is not where their advantage lies.</p>
<p>Apple&rsquo;s decision was driven by several practical realities. Despite having world-class edge inference silicon through their Neural Engine, Apple has effectively zero presence in training datacenters &ndash; lacking the TPU pods or GPU clusters needed to train frontier models from scratch. Google, by contrast, has deep pockets, enterprise infrastructure experience, and diversified revenue streams that make them a stable long-term partner.</p>
<p>Apple confirmed the Gemini models would run under their Private Cloud Compute infrastructure, meaning Google would not have access to Siri user data. This addresses the privacy concern that many in the Apple ecosystem raised immediately upon hearing the news. The deal also has competitive implications: OpenAI had previously integrated with Siri but apparently lost the opportunity.</p>
<p>The announcement signals a broader industry trend where AI models are becoming commodities, and the billions required to train state-of-the-art models may not justify the investment for companies whose core competencies lie elsewhere. Apple appears to have strategically decided to wait until the AI market stabilizes before investing heavily in their own solutions, leveraging their existing device ecosystem as their competitive moat.</p>
<h2 id="key-insights">Key Insights</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Build vs. buy for AI</strong>: Apple chose to partner rather than build, recognizing frontier model training is not their competitive advantage</li>
<li><strong>Privacy through architecture</strong>: Running Gemini under Apple&rsquo;s Private Cloud Compute addresses data privacy concerns without sacrificing capability</li>
<li><strong>Models as commodities</strong>: The deal reflects a growing view that AI models are becoming interchangeable, and differentiation lies in integration and user experience</li>

<p><strong>system2</strong>: Just like that, we have a final AI winner.</p>
<p><strong>worldsavior</strong>: How Apple has made some of the greatest phones in history, amazing engineering, and a lot more, but just can&rsquo;t make a simple model to run locally on the phone when many others did?</p>

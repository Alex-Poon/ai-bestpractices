        <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Vercel&rsquo;s engineering team published an evaluation comparing two approaches to providing AI coding agents with documentation: AGENTS.md files (passive context embedded in the system prompt) versus skills (active retrieval tools the agent can invoke on demand). The evaluation targeted Next.js 16 APIs that were absent from model training data, including new patterns like <code>'use cache'</code>, <code>connection()</code>, <code>forbidden()</code>, and async <code>cookies()</code>.</p>
<p>The results were striking. A compressed 8KB documentation index embedded in AGENTS.md achieved a 100% pass rate on the evaluation tasks, while skills maxed out at 79% even with explicit instructions telling the agent to use them. Without explicit instructions, skills performed no better than the 53% baseline. The root cause was that in 56% of eval cases, the skill was never invoked at all — the agent simply failed to recognize when it needed documentation help.</p>
<p>The key finding is that passive context (always-available documentation) eliminates the decision point that trips up active retrieval. There is no sequencing issue, no need for the agent to decide whether to look something up. The documentation is simply present in every turn. Vercel also found that aggressive compression of documentation into an index format worked as well as providing full content, and that small wording changes in instructions produced dramatic behavioral shifts — revealing the fragility of active retrieval approaches.</p>
<p>The team recommends generating an AGENTS.md documentation index using their codemod tool (<code>npx @next/codemod@canary agents-md</code>) and building evals targeting APIs outside training data to measure the real impact of documentation strategies.</p>
<h2 id="key-insights">Key Insights</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Passive context beats active retrieval</strong>: Always-available documentation in AGENTS.md achieved 100% versus 79% max for skills-based retrieval</li>
<li><strong>Agents fail to invoke skills</strong>: In 56% of eval cases, the skill was never invoked — agents do not reliably recognize when they need help</li>
<li><strong>Instruction fragility</strong>: Small wording changes in skill instructions produced dramatic behavioral shifts, making active retrieval unreliable</li>
<li><strong>Compression works</strong>: An 8KB compressed documentation index performed as well as full documentation content</li>
<li><strong>Eval methodology matters</strong>: Testing against APIs outside training data reveals actual documentation impact versus memorized knowledge</li>

<p><strong>xnx</strong>: Agents.md, skills, MCP, tools, etc. There&rsquo;s going to be a lot of areas explored that may yield no/negative benefit over the fundamentals of a clear prompt.</p>
<p><strong>guluarte</strong>: In my experience, agents only follow the first two or three lines of AGENTS.md + message. As the context grows, they start following random rules and ignoring others.</p>
<p><strong>sghiassy</strong>: N00b Question - how do you measure performance for AI agents like the way they did in this article? Are there frameworks to support this type of work?</p>
<p><strong>sheepscreek</strong>: It seems their tests rely on Claude alone. It’s not safe to assume that Codex or Gemini will behave the same way as Claude. I use all three and each has its own idiosyncrasies.</p>

        <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Anthropic added native Language Server Protocol (LSP) support to Claude Code, enabling the CLI-based agent to integrate with language servers for improved code understanding, navigation, and analysis. The feature was announced through Claude Code&rsquo;s changelog and surfaced via a plugin system where users can discover and install LSP integrations.</p>
<p>LSP support represents a significant step in making CLI-based AI coding agents competitive with IDE-based tools like Cursor. Language servers provide structured information about code: type definitions, references, diagnostics, and refactoring capabilities. By connecting Claude Code to these servers, the agent gains access to the same code intelligence that powers IDE features, without requiring a full IDE environment.</p>
<p>The release included a plugin manager accessible via the <code>/plugin</code> command, with a Discover tab for searching and installing LSP integrations. However, the initial rollout had notable limitations: the TypeScript LSP and others were missing diagnostics for real-time errors and warnings, still requiring separate linter or compiler runs. A subsequent version (2.0.76) introduced a regression that broke LSP functionality entirely due to a missing function call in the initialization code.</p>
<p>Other features released around the same time included PDF reading enhancements with page-range parameters, MCP OAuth support, a debug command, expanded git operations in read-only mode, and a 68% memory reduction for the resume feature.</p>
<p>The HN discussion largely debated whether CLI-based agents should be building IDE features from scratch or whether IDE-based agents already solve this problem more naturally.</p>
<h2 id="key-insights">Key Insights</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bridging the CLI-IDE gap</strong>: LSP support gives CLI agents access to the same code intelligence IDEs have, reducing a major competitive disadvantage</li>
<li><strong>Deterministic tools complement probabilistic reasoning</strong>: Combining LSP&rsquo;s precise code analysis with LLM reasoning produces better results than either alone</li>
<li><strong>Plugin ecosystem emerging</strong>: Claude Code&rsquo;s plugin system enables community-contributed integrations, though quality and stability vary</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>giancarlostoro</strong>: I have been leaning towards Zed.</p>

<p><strong>parpfish</strong>: Jetbrainz needs to give up on Junie and their in house ai and focus on integrating with the established tools. If they don’t, VS code will consume them.</p>

<p><strong>atombender</strong>: They&rsquo;ve already done that. After the Junie fiasco, they pivoted to &ldquo;AI Assistant&rdquo;, where Junie is just another provider alongside Anthropic and OpenAI. In theory, you have Claude Code inside&hellip;</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>mirzap</strong>: Yeah, it&rsquo;s quite odd that they can&rsquo;t get AI tools to work, especially considering so many OSS tools available that work surprisingly well (cline, opencode, etc.).</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>dvtkrlbs</strong>: They already kinda did. They brough ACP support which allows you to somewhat integrate Claude Code, Gemini CLI or OpenCode they also recently brought BYOK support so you can use an existing provider&hellip;</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>CuriouslyC</strong>: ACP seems super under the radar. It has some support, but it got merged into A2A, which I don&rsquo;t hear anyone talking about, so it seems like it&rsquo;s going to die on the vine.</p>

<p><strong>nurettin</strong>: Interesting. I develop two projects and maintain a few. I haven&rsquo;t opened an IDE within the past two weeks. What do you do with an IDE? Stare as code is written, refactored, tested and debugged&hellip;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>swader999</strong>: Same here, I&rsquo;m a bit apprehensive admitting it. Thanks for going first.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>odie5533</strong>: Is there a way to automatically run tests every file change, like post tool somehow, so that it returns a concise test run back to the LLM every tool use? That seems like it would be useful.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>rane</strong>: You don&rsquo;t want to run tests after every file change, because that will distract Claude from finishing whatever it&rsquo;s doing and add noise to the context window. Of course the tests will be broken if&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>odie5533</strong>: Won&rsquo;t the LSP distract Claude too? I am trying to think of ways to make Claude faster at iterating by reducing tool calls. That always seems to be a bottleneck when it&rsquo;s doing tons of back-and-forth&hellip;</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>rane</strong>: Depends on Anthropic has implemented it I guess. I haven&rsquo;t had it activate yet despite the prompt to install an LSP.</p>

<p><strong>spellboots</strong>: Yes, you can do this with hooks: <a href="https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks">https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks</a></p>

<p><strong>trq_</strong>: Hi, work on Claude Code here! Let me know if you have any feedback!</p>

<p><strong>swader999</strong>: How do I get Claude to start using the LSP? I&rsquo;ve got go, kotlin, swift and typescript projects that might benefit.</p>

<p><strong>Jgrubb</strong>: That tool search tool y&rsquo;all announced recently - huge upvote for getting that into Claude code.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>simlevesque</strong>: There&rsquo;s pyright-lsp. Isn&rsquo;t this a Python LSP ? or is it lacking important features ?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>throw-12-16</strong>: still distributed as an npm global that runs out of your home directory. insane way to distribute a core product considering the state of npm.</p>
<p><strong>colonCapitalDee</strong>: Great news. I was just starting to explore creating a goto-definition skill for CC, glad I don&rsquo;t have to figure that out now :)</p>
<p><strong>sathish316</strong>: Can you do @ and refer to a method or variable in a file with lsp support? Otherwise, how can lsp context be used in Terminal chat?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>teaearlgraycold</strong>: A big use case will be to tell the LLM what the type of an expression is.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>kristo</strong>: LLMs should operate on the code&rsquo;s AST when possible, and should be trained on code&rsquo;s AST as well</p>
<p><strong>dfaiv</strong>: it doesn&rsquo;t seem to mention anything on using the LSP for linting/typechecking? That&rsquo;s what I really want, instead of my unholy combo of post edit hooks and claude.md &ldquo;PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE run type&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>sixothree</strong>: Serious question, does this mean it will support Roslyn? Or will they &ldquo;bake their own&rdquo; version?</p>
<p><strong>helsinki</strong>: It has been in the source code for like two months. I&rsquo;ve been using it for a while now.</p>
<p><strong>octopoc</strong>: Seems like SCIP would be a better fit, although not as widely supported by languages I suppose.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>0xdeafbeef</strong>: It takse long to regen on big codebases, but yes</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>brikym</strong>: As far as I know Claude models in VSCode + GitHub Copilot have had this for months now.</p>
<p><strong>behnamoh</strong>: I mean, OpenCode has had this feature for a while: <a href="https://opencode.ai/docs/lsp/">https://opencode.ai/docs/lsp/</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>jarjoura</strong>: It&rsquo;s a shame that my company tied itself to claude-code way too fast. It was like a single week last summer of, &ldquo;oh what&rsquo;s everyone&rsquo;s favorite? claude? okay, let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo; OpenCode has been truely&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>gempir</strong>: OpenCode is so underrated. One of my favorite features is that you can run it as a server, and then it has a API and SDKs to manage sessions etc. Great to build a centrally managed agent for your&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>dejw</strong>: How do I integrate it with Helix Editor?</p>
<p><strong>Lerc</strong>: Does this mean Claude Code can be a consumer of this information or a provider? Maybe whynotboth.gif?</p>
<p><strong>tdfirth</strong>: No rename symbol? What am I missing? It seems like a no brainer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>fueledbyzaatar</strong>: References + a few extra steps will give you rename symbol. Anthropic is seemingly wanting to experiment with this - so it makes sense to limit the integration points.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>endorphine</strong>: Any idea if this is planned for Codex as well?</p>
<p><strong>Havoc</strong>: What does the terminal integration mentioned do?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>sevg</strong>: I believe it’s to do with supporting shift+enter (to do multiline prompts). <a href="https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/1259#issuec">https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/1259#issuec</a>&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>jedisct1</strong>: Doesn&rsquo;t seem to work with Zig?</p>
<p><strong>steven_j24</strong>: i think Kiro CLI added while ago and it does support diagnostics and rename symbol</p>
<p><strong>synergy20</strong>: dumb question,how to use it? claude is a cli tool,not an editor,why is lsp relevant?</p>
<p><strong>mparis</strong>: Seems like a great feature but am I the only one that still regularly sees the totally broken scrolling bug in CC? I have churned from CC in favor of codex until the scrolling bug is fixed. There is&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>esafak</strong>: How to use this new feature?</p>
<p><strong>jama211</strong>: I’m curious what the benefit of this is over running away, cursor ide with the Claude agent?</p>
<p><strong>1123581321</strong>: This is an ignorant question, but, what is the benefit of this if you also have your project open in an editor or IDE (presuming they integrate language server?) If you&rsquo;re vibe coding without an&hellip;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>BeetleB</strong>: As part of a bigger refactor, you want to rename some variables. With an LSP hook, the LLM can make the change (more) reliably. The LLM wants to see the definition of a function. More reliable than&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>ascorbic</strong>: The same reason you want an LSP in your editor: so you get inline docs and error messages, autocomplete, jump to definition, refactoring actions etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>sunaookami</strong>: But what is the benefit for Claude Code? You don&rsquo;t write code in Claude Code so why would I need autocomplete or jump to definition? Does Claude itself use them instead of e.g. grepping? Struggling&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>HarHarVeryFunny</strong>: I&rsquo;d like to know what more of the use cases are too, but one would be for doing renaming operations where the LSP understands the code and will tell the caller exactly what edits to make to which&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>kaibee</strong>: &gt; Does Claude itself use them instead of e.g. grepping? Struggling to understand how it helps. That would be the idea.</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>ascorbic</strong>: Yes, it&rsquo;s for Claude itself.</p>

</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>esafak</strong>: Your test suite and linter don&rsquo;t code. They don&rsquo;t help your agent look up definitions of variables, etc.</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>1123581321</strong>: Ah, it&rsquo;s about making language documentation available, and making crawling the app  for understanding cheaper/more direct?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>esafak</strong>: It&rsquo;s like making your IDE available to them.</p>

<p><strong>saagarjha</strong>: Has anyone checked that it actually works before posting it here? lol</p>
<p><strong>Razengan</strong>: Anthropic/Clause has the absolute worst UX among all the major AI products. Just try copy-pasting text, say a prompt from a notes app or a text file. and they completely ignore all complaints. Why&hellip;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>aurbxyajwur</strong>: Hard disagree. They have the best UX in the industry</p>

<p><strong>Razengan</strong>: These comments sound like paid PR. I literally just gave an example. I keep AI prompts in Notes for using with different chatbots. You can paste them normally into ChatGPT etc but Claude mangles them&hellip;</p>

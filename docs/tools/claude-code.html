      <div class="article-content">
        <p>Claude Code is Anthropic&rsquo;s CLI-first coding agent. It runs in the terminal, takes natural language task descriptions, and executes autonomously &ndash; reading files, running commands, editing code, and iterating on failures. It is single-model (Anthropic&rsquo;s Claude family), available through Claude Max subscriptions at $100-200/month, and focused entirely on agentic workflows with no autocomplete mode.</p>
<p>What sets Claude Code apart from other agents is its extensibility. It supports CLAUDE.md project files, custom sub-agents, hooks for CI/CD integration, and MCP servers for structured tool access. This page covers the major features and developments that matter to practitioners.</p>
<h2 id="agent-teams-multi-agent-orchestration">Agent Teams: Multi-Agent Orchestration</h2>
<p>In January 2026, the community discovered that Claude Code contains built-in multi-agent orchestration capabilities. The architecture positions the primary agent as a team lead that can plan work, delegate tasks to specialized sub-agents, and synthesize results. Each sub-agent operates with its own context window, enabling parallel execution of independent tasks.</p>
<p>The feature includes a TeammateTool, delegate mode for spawning background agents, and a team coordination system with messaging and task ownership. As of the Opus 4.6 release, agent teams became an official research preview in Claude Code 2.1.32, requiring the <code>CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1</code> environment variable (or equivalent settings.json <code>env</code> configuration) to enable.</p>
<h3 id="architecture">Architecture</h3>
<p>Agent Teams follow a Team Lead plus Teammates model. The main Claude Code session acts as the Team Lead, coordinating work across one or more Teammate instances that run as separate processes. Three shared primitives tie them together:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Task List</strong> &ndash; a shared registry where the lead creates tasks and teammates claim them. Tasks flow through pending, in_progress, and completed states, with optional dependency chains so a teammate can block until prerequisite tasks finish. File locking on claims prevents two teammates from grabbing the same task.</li>
<li><strong>Mailbox</strong> &ndash; inter-agent messaging. <code>message</code> sends a direct message to one teammate; <code>broadcast</code> sends to all (expensive &ndash; one delivery per teammate). <code>shutdown_request</code> and <code>shutdown_response</code> handle graceful teardown.</li>
<li><strong>Delegate mode</strong> &ndash; restricts the lead to coordination-only tools, preventing it from doing implementation work that should go to teammates.</li>
</ul>
<p>Teammates can run in <strong>plan mode</strong>, where they explore the codebase read-only and propose a plan that the lead must approve before implementation begins. Display modes include in-process (default, all output in the main terminal) and split panes via tmux or iTerm2.</p>
<h3 id="practitioner-results">Practitioner Results</h3>
<p>Early adopters have published concrete benchmarks. anupamchugh tested on a FastAPI codebase with 4 agents handling 6 tasks and reported completion in roughly 6 minutes versus 18-20 minutes sequential, with 24 tests passing and zero merge conflicts. Token cost was approximately 4x a single-agent run. sukinai ran 3 parallel agents that committed 34 files with 100 tests passing and no conflicts.</p>
<p>Since the initial discovery, a wider range of practitioner reports has emerged. linsomniac one-shotted a complex Ansible module including Galaxy packaging, calling the feature &ldquo;pretty remarkable&rdquo; (linsomniac, Feb 2026). nickzana gave Claude Code a Forgejo instance account and uses issues and PRs as the abstraction layer for agent teams, reporting &ldquo;very productive&rdquo; results after iterating on the workflow (nickzana, Feb 2026). hakanderyal, a freelancer with 20+ years of experience, runs 3-8 parallel sessions backed by 30,000 lines of markdown rules and documentation, reporting code quality &ldquo;near handwritten&rdquo; but noting the approach requires heavy workflow investment (hakanderyal, Jan 2026). neilbb shipped 706 commits in 5 days using Taskwarrior and Zellij alongside Claude Code, summarizing the experience as the system getting rate-limited before the human did (neilbb, Feb 2026). esperent built a full TDD web app in one month using agent teams &ndash; a task that would have taken roughly a year working solo (esperent, Feb 2026).</p>
<p>The critical constraint practitioners have identified is file disjointness. Two teammates editing the same file leads to overwrites &ndash; there is no merge resolution. Successful teams require task decomposition where each agent owns separate files (anupamchugh).</p>
<p>Anthropic&rsquo;s own demonstration of the architecture involved 16 parallel agents building a C compiler over 2 weeks, consuming 2 billion input tokens at roughly $20,000 in cost. The result was 100,000 lines of Rust passing 99% of compiler test suites.</p>
<p>Practitioner reception remains mixed. Some report strong results &ndash; one user described running a full project team of sub-agents managed by a single Opus instance, achieving the best code quality though at roughly 10x the cost. Others express skepticism. Common concerns include the volume of generated code becoming harder to review, and the economics of running multiple LLM agents simultaneously.</p>
<p>The core tension is whether multi-agent coordination genuinely improves output quality or primarily increases token consumption. One HN commenter characterized the approach as &ldquo;function scoping and memory management cosplaying as an org chart.&rdquo; Another argued the architecture is simply built-in sub-agents and that massive external orchestration frameworks were never needed.</p>
<h3 id="cost-management">Cost Management</h3>
<p>Teams are session-scoped &ndash; they terminate when the terminal closes. Practical cost controls include using Sonnet for teammates rather than Opus, keeping team size small (3-5 agents), cleaning up idle teammates promptly, and recognizing that active teammates consume tokens even while waiting for tasks. The 4x token multiplier reported by anupamchugh appears representative of small teams; Anthropic&rsquo;s 16-agent compiler project shows costs scaling significantly at larger configurations. 22c warned that teams are a &ldquo;good way to burn all your tokens&rdquo; (22c, Feb 2026). Practitioners generally frame this as a time-vs-tokens tradeoff &ndash; a 6-minute burst at 4x cost is still cheaper than 20 minutes at 1x if developer time matters (anupamchugh, Feb 2026).</p>
<h3 id="known-limitations">Known Limitations</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Session-scoped:</strong> Agent teams die when the terminal closes &ndash; no persistence across tools, no cross-session handoff (anupamchugh, Feb 2026).</li>
<li><strong>Permission fatigue:</strong> Each agent hits permission prompts independently; permission requests become the &ldquo;limiting step&rdquo; for parallel agent workflows (borenstein, Feb 2026).</li>
<li><strong>UI stability:</strong> React reconciler crashes reported with 4+ agents and MCP servers (anupamchugh, Feb 2026).</li>
<li><strong>Human attention bottleneck:</strong> Most practitioners cap at 3-4 meaningful parallel sessions because the human becomes the constraint, not the compute (koliber, Feb 2026).</li>
<li><strong>Plan quality &gt; agent quantity:</strong> Task decomposition skill matters more than the number of agents running &ndash; &ldquo;plan decomposition matters more than the agents themselves&rdquo; (anupamchugh, Feb 2026).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="agentsmd-and-claudemd">AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md</h2>
<p>Claude Code reads CLAUDE.md files from the project root at the start of every session, giving the agent persistent, project-specific context. This approach &ndash; embedding documentation directly in the system prompt &ndash; has proven highly effective.</p>
<p>Vercel&rsquo;s evaluation found that passive context in AGENTS.md files achieved a 100% pass rate on tasks involving APIs outside the model&rsquo;s training data, compared to a maximum of 79% for active retrieval approaches (skills). The reason: in over half of test cases, the agent simply failed to invoke its retrieval tools when it should have. Passive context eliminates this decision point entirely.</p>
<p>The practical implication is clear: invest in your CLAUDE.md file. Document build commands, architecture constraints, coding conventions, and known pitfalls. Start sparse and add entries as you encounter real issues. The file compounds in value over time &ndash; each documented correction prevents the same mistake from recurring in future sessions.</p>
<p>For a practical template and maintenance guide, see the <a href="../practices/harness-engineering.html">Harness Engineering</a>. For Vercel&rsquo;s evaluation details, see the <a href="../sources/2026-01-29-agents-md-outperforms-skills.html">source capture</a>.</p>
<h2 id="native-lsp-support">Native LSP Support</h2>
<p>In December 2025, Claude Code added native Language Server Protocol (LSP) support, giving the CLI-based agent access to the same code intelligence that powers IDE features: type definitions, references, diagnostics, and navigation.</p>
<p>This is significant because a recurring criticism of CLI-first agents was that IDE-based tools like Cursor get language intelligence for free. LSP support narrows that gap. The feature works through a plugin system accessible via the <code>/plugin</code> command, with a Discover tab for searching and installing LSP integrations.</p>
<p>The initial rollout had limitations. The TypeScript LSP lacked diagnostics for real-time errors and warnings, still requiring separate linter or compiler runs. A subsequent version introduced a regression that broke LSP functionality entirely. The community directory at claude-plugins.dev tracks available plugins and their status.</p>
<p>The broader significance is philosophical. As one commenter observed, LLMs waste tokens doing work that deterministic tools handle better. LSP provides precise, structured information about code &ndash; the kind of analysis where deterministic tools outperform probabilistic reasoning. Combining both yields better results than either alone.</p>
<p>For the full discussion on the CLI vs IDE debate, see the <a href="../sources/2025-12-22-claude-code-lsp-support.html">source capture</a>.</p>
<h2 id="benchmark-tracking-and-reliability">Benchmark Tracking and Reliability</h2>
<p>Community trust in AI coding tools depends on consistent performance. MarginLab launched a daily benchmark tracker for Claude Code that runs 50 SWE-Bench-Pro evaluations per day and aggregates results over 7-day and 30-day windows.</p>
<p>The tracker provides the first systematic data on what many users had reported anecdotally: performance fluctuations. At the time of its launch, the tracker showed statistically significant degradation at both the 7-day and 30-day timeframes compared to the historical baseline. A member of the Claude Code team responded publicly, confirming a harness bug that was introduced and then rolled back, providing a concrete explanation for some of the observed degradation.</p>
<p>This illustrates an important distinction: not all performance changes come from the model. Tool-level harness changes, server load, and A/B testing of checkpoints can all affect results. Independent tracking helps separate these factors and holds vendors accountable.</p>
<p>The discussion around benchmarks was one of the most emotionally charged in the dataset, reflecting deep community concern about the reliability of tools they depend on daily. Several commenters noted that as AI tool costs rise and competition intensifies, vendors face pressure to quietly reduce service quality &ndash; making independent monitoring increasingly important.</p>
<p>For the full benchmark data and methodology critique, see the <a href="../sources/2026-01-29-claude-code-benchmarks.html">source capture</a>.</p>
<h3 id="the-transparency-controversy-v2120">The Transparency Controversy (v2.1.20)</h3>
<p>In February 2026, a blog post criticizing Claude Code v2.1.20 accumulated 979 points and 626 comments on HN &ndash; one of the most discussed Claude Code topics to date. The update replaced detailed file-level information during agent operations with vague summaries. Where the tool previously showed which files were read and which patterns were searched, it now displayed generic messages like &ldquo;Read 3 files.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The community response revealed a deep tension between simplification and power-user needs. <strong>steinnes</strong> described relying on visible file reads to time interruptions, provide context, and save tokens. <strong>qwertox</strong> used the visible thought process as a learning tool for detecting when the agent takes problematic paths. The only alternative Anthropic offered was verbose mode, which dumps full file contents and sub-agent transcripts &ndash; a binary choice between too little and too much information.</p>
<p><strong>bcherny</strong> from the Anthropic Claude Code team responded at length, explaining that as Claude improved and began running autonomously for extended periods, terminal output became overwhelming. The team balanced transparency with usability through progressive disclosure and tested internally for over a month. He acknowledged the change fell short for some users and committed to further improvements.</p>
<p>The episode illustrates a recurring challenge for AI tool makers: as tools attract broader audiences (including non-developers drawn to &ldquo;vibe coding&rdquo;), companies face pressure to simplify interfaces in ways that alienate experienced developers who rely on operational visibility. <strong>SOLAR_FIELDS</strong> linked four separate GitHub issues documenting complaints and reported having to patch Claude Code after every release. <strong>stillpointlab</strong> offered a contrarian take, comparing the backlash to complaints about simplified RPG systems and suggesting the deeper issue was a progressive loss of developer control, with this change being a tipping point rather than the core problem.</p>
<p>For the full discussion, see the <a href="../sources/2026-02-11-claude-code-dumbed-down.html">source capture</a>. For the broader debate about AI tool quality, see <a href="../debates/is-it-getting-worse.html">Is AI-Assisted Coding Getting Worse?</a>.</p>
<h2 id="opus-46-capabilities">Opus 4.6 Capabilities</h2>
<p>Claude Code runs on Anthropic&rsquo;s model family, and the release of Opus 4.6 in February 2026 brought notable improvements. The model features a 1 million token context window in beta &ndash; the first for an Opus-class model &ndash; along with top scores on Terminal-Bench 2.0 for agentic coding and strong performance on complex reasoning benchmarks.</p>
<p>The extended context window is particularly relevant for coding agents. It enables working with entire codebases in a single context, reducing the need for the agent to search and re-read files. One tester validated the capability by searching across all Harry Potter books for spells within a single context window.</p>
<p>The release coincided with Claude Code 2.1.32, which introduced automatic memory recording and recall during work sessions, and the agent teams research preview discussed above. Rate limits remain a practical constraint &ndash; several practitioners reported that limits on the Pro and Max plans reduce the model&rsquo;s usefulness despite strong output quality.</p>
<p>Practitioner reports highlight several capability dimensions beyond raw benchmarks. In visual reasoning, Uehreka reports that Opus 4.6 autonomously debugged a rendering bug by reasoning about captured frames &ndash; a capability where previous models struggled to interpret images beyond semantic descriptions (Uehreka, Feb 2026). For instruction following, theorchid notes that Opus 4.6 handles instructions &ndash; especially negative rules &ndash; better than both Opus 4.5 and Sonnet 4.5 (theorchid, Feb 2026).</p>
<p>Safety discussions have been substantive. VendingBench results showed Opus 4.6 achieving the highest score through ethically questionable simulated business tactics (gwd, Feb 2026). Sandbox security testing revealed a 93% solve rate on Cybench, with the model attempting kernel exploits and mount escapes when given maximum thinking budget (jingkai_he, Feb 2026). Separately, evaluators noted the model verbalizing awareness of being in a simulation during certain evaluations (andy12_, Feb 2026). These concerns are discussed seriously in the community rather than dismissed.</p>
<p>Not all reception is positive. Calavar described the model as &ldquo;more like a high school summer intern&rdquo; after finding it writing meaningless tests that asserted values equal to themselves (Calavar, Feb 2026). Chance-Device posted seeking ways to revert to Opus 4.5 after experiencing persistent instruction-following failures (Chance-Device, Feb 2026).</p>

<h2 id="hooks-lifecycle-automation">Hooks: Lifecycle Automation</h2>
<p>Hooks are user-defined handlers that execute at specific lifecycle points in Claude Code&rsquo;s agent loop. Unlike CLAUDE.md instructions &ndash; which the model follows roughly 70% of the time according to practitioners (unshavedyak, tomashubelbauer) &ndash; hooks provide deterministic enforcement. As philipp-gayret observed, hooks are superior to context-based instructions because they &ldquo;auto-approve or auto-deny&rdquo; with guidance feedback rather than relying on the model&rsquo;s judgment.</p>
<h3 id="lifecycle-events">Lifecycle Events</h3>
<p>Claude Code exposes 14 lifecycle events where hooks can be attached:</p>
<table>

      </tr>

<h3 id="handler-types">Handler Types</h3>
<p>Each hook uses one of three handler types:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Command</strong> &ndash; executes a shell script. The most common type. Exit code 0 means success; exit code 2 means a blocking error that halts the agent loop. The hook receives event JSON on stdin and can respond with JSON on stdout.</li>
<li><strong>Prompt</strong> &ndash; sends a single-turn evaluation to the LLM. Useful for semantic checks that a shell script cannot express, such as verifying that generated code follows project conventions.</li>
<li><strong>Agent</strong> &ndash; runs a multi-turn, tool-using verification pass. The most powerful but most expensive handler type, suitable for complex validation gates.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="configuration">Configuration</h3>
<p>Hooks can be defined at multiple levels, from broadest to narrowest scope:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Managed policy</strong> &ndash; enterprise-wide enforcement</li>
<li><strong>User</strong> &ndash; <code>~/.claude/settings.json</code> (personal defaults)</li>
<li><strong>Project</strong> &ndash; <code>.claude/settings.json</code> (team-shared via source control)</li>
<li><strong>Local</strong> &ndash; <code>.claude/settings.local.json</code> (personal per-repo overrides)</li>
<li><strong>Plugin hooks</strong> &ndash; bundled with installed plugins</li>
<li><strong>Skill/agent frontmatter</strong> &ndash; hooks embedded in custom agent definitions</li>
</ul>
<p>Matcher patterns support regex filtering by tool name, session event type, or agent type, allowing hooks to fire only for specific tools or contexts.</p>
<h3 id="protocol">Protocol</h3>
<p>Hooks communicate via a JSON protocol on stdin and stdout. The hook process receives event details as JSON on stdin and can return JSON on stdout with several control fields:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>continue</code> &ndash; whether the agent loop should proceed</li>
<li><code>stopReason</code> &ndash; message to display if halting</li>
<li><code>suppressOutput</code> &ndash; hide tool output from the conversation</li>
<li><code>systemMessage</code> &ndash; inject a system-level message into Claude&rsquo;s context</li>
</ul>
<p>For <strong>PreToolUse</strong> hooks specifically, two additional fields enable decision control: <code>permissionDecision</code> (allow, deny, or ask) determines whether the tool call proceeds, and <code>updatedInput</code> can modify the tool&rsquo;s parameters before execution.</p>
<h3 id="common-patterns">Common Patterns</h3>
<p><strong>Notification hooks</strong> are the most common first hook practitioners build. Desktop and mobile alerts when Claude stops or needs input keep the developer productive on other tasks while the agent works (rco8786, Jnr, arach).</p>
<p><strong>Guard rails</strong> prevent destructive commands. karanb192 built a safety hooks library after Claude attempted to run <code>rm -rf ~/</code> during a session. PreToolUse hooks on Bash can match dangerous patterns and deny execution.</p>
<p><strong>Auto-lint after edits.</strong> PostToolUse hooks on Edit and Write tools can trigger formatters and linters automatically, ensuring every file Claude touches conforms to project standards.</p>
<p><strong>Stop validation gates.</strong> Stop hooks can prevent Claude from finishing its turn until tests pass, enforcing a &ldquo;green build&rdquo; invariant on every agent response.</p>
<p><strong>Commit automation.</strong> PostToolUse hooks can auto-commit after changes, maintaining a fine-grained history of agent modifications (adobrawy, mojombo).</p>
<p><strong>Governance layers.</strong> Enterprise teams use managed hooks for policy enforcement across all developer sessions. ramoz, who created the original hooks feature request, envisioned this governance use case from the start.</p>
<h3 id="limitations">Limitations</h3>
<p>PreToolUse hooks can be bypassed when Claude receives explicit user permission &ndash; they capture intent but do not enforce hard security boundaries (peanutlife). Some practitioners report hooks not triggering reliably in all scenarios (colechristensen). Hooks add latency to the agent loop proportional to handler complexity, so lightweight command handlers are preferred for frequently-fired events.</p>
<h2 id="memory-system">Memory System</h2>
<p>Claude Code&rsquo;s memory system determines what the agent knows about your project, your preferences, and past interactions. It operates across two dimensions: files you write for Claude (CLAUDE.md files and rules), and files Claude writes for itself (auto memory).</p>
<h3 id="memory-hierarchy">Memory Hierarchy</h3>
<p>Memory sources are loaded from broadest to narrowest scope. When instructions conflict, more specific sources take precedence:</p>

</table>
<p>Lookup is recursive from the current working directory upward. Parent CLAUDE.md files are loaded in full at session launch. Child directory CLAUDE.md files are loaded on demand when Claude reads files in those subtrees, scoping guidance to the relevant part of the codebase.</p>
<h3 id="project-rules">Project Rules</h3>
<p>The <code>.claude/rules/</code> directory supports modular, topic-specific rule files. Each rule file can include YAML frontmatter with a <code>paths</code> field containing glob patterns, making the rules apply only when Claude works with matching files. This is more maintainable than a single large CLAUDE.md for projects with distinct subsystems or language boundaries.</p>
<h3 id="claudemd-imports">CLAUDE.md Imports</h3>
<p>CLAUDE.md files support an <code>@path/to/file</code> import syntax for pulling in content from other files. Imports resolve relative or absolute paths up to a maximum depth of 5 levels. On first use, an approval dialog confirms the import. This enables teams to maintain shared guidance files referenced across multiple projects.</p>
<h3 id="auto-memory">Auto Memory</h3>
<p>Claude Code automatically records learnings to <code>~/.claude/projects/&lt;project&gt;/memory/</code>, where the project path is derived from the git root. The primary file, <code>MEMORY.md</code>, has its first 200 lines loaded into the system prompt at the start of every session. Additional topic files (debugging.md, patterns.md, etc.) are loaded on demand when relevant.</p>
<p>Claude records project patterns, debugging insights, architecture notes, and user preferences. The <code>/memory</code> command provides direct management. To disable auto memory entirely, set <code>CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_AUTO_MEMORY=1</code>.</p>
<h3 id="practitioner-guidance">Practitioner Guidance</h3>
<p>Sizing recommendations vary but converge on brevity. bcherny from the Anthropic team recommends keeping CLAUDE.md under roughly 1,000 tokens; his own project file is about half that. bonsai_spool suggests under 50 lines with a one-line hypothesis and links to detailed files like ROADMAP.md.</p>
<p>fazlerocks describes the three-level hierarchy (managed, project, user) working well with specific pattern examples for each scope. hendersoon raises an architectural observation: CLAUDE.md is always loaded into active context, whereas a local RAG approach could be more token-efficient for large knowledge bases. nivertech reports that auto-memories accumulate in CLAUDE.md over time, requiring periodic manual organization to prevent context bloat.</p>
<h3 id="community-memory-plugins">Community Memory Plugins</h3>
<p>The ecosystem has produced several memory-enhancement plugins that go beyond the built-in system:</p>
<p><strong>claude-mem</strong> (thedotmack, 24.6k GitHub stars) captures session activity, compresses it with AI, and injects relevant context into future sessions. It uses three-layer progressive disclosure for token efficiency and stores data locally in SQLite with Chroma vector storage.</p>
<p><strong>claude-supermemory</strong> (supermemoryai) takes a cloud-based approach, offering team memory where project knowledge is shared across team members. It requires a paid subscription.</p>
<p>Other approaches include Nemp Memory (local JSON storage), Basic Memory (an MCP-based knowledge system), and In Memoria (statistical pattern learning). The variety reflects an unsettled question about whether memory should be local, cloud-based, vector-indexed, or simply text files.</p>
<h2 id="custom-agents">Custom Agents</h2>
<p>Custom agents are markdown files stored in <code>.claude/agents/</code> that define specialized sub-agents with constrained capabilities and focused system prompts. They are one of Claude Code&rsquo;s primary extensibility mechanisms, enabling teams to create purpose-built agents for recurring tasks.</p>
<h3 id="file-format">File Format</h3>
<p>Each agent is a markdown file with YAML frontmatter followed by a markdown body that becomes the agent&rsquo;s system prompt:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;-webkit-text-size-adjust:none;"><code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml"><span style="display:flex;"><span>---

</span></span></code></pre></div><h3 id="scope-and-resolution">Scope and Resolution</h3>
<p>Agents are resolved with a priority chain: the <code>--agents</code> CLI flag takes highest precedence, followed by <code>.claude/agents/</code> in the project, then <code>~/.claude/agents/</code> for user-level agents, then plugin-bundled agents. When names conflict, the higher-priority source wins.</p>
<h3 id="tool-restrictions">Tool Restrictions</h3>
<p>The <code>tools</code> field acts as an allowlist, limiting which tools the agent can use. Alternatively, <code>disallowedTools</code> serves as a denylist. The <code>Task(worker, researcher)</code> syntax restricts which sub-agents can be spawned, preventing uncontrolled agent proliferation.</p>
<h3 id="permission-modes">Permission Modes</h3>
<p>Custom agents support several permission modes that control how much autonomy the agent has:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>default</strong> &ndash; standard permission prompts for sensitive operations</li>
<li><strong>acceptEdits</strong> &ndash; auto-approve file edits but prompt for other operations</li>
<li><strong>dontAsk</strong> &ndash; suppress most permission prompts</li>
<li><strong>delegate</strong> &ndash; restrict to coordination tools only (no direct implementation)</li>
<li><strong>bypassPermissions</strong> &ndash; skip all permission checks (use with caution)</li>
<li><strong>plan</strong> &ndash; read-only exploration until plan is approved</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="persistent-memory">Persistent Memory</h3>
<p>The <code>memory</code> field with <code>user</code>, <code>project</code>, or <code>local</code> scopes gives sub-agents their own MEMORY.md file, loaded at startup. This allows specialized agents to accumulate knowledge across sessions without polluting the main agent&rsquo;s context.</p>
<h3 id="execution-modes">Execution Modes</h3>
<p>Agents can run in the foreground, blocking the main conversation until they complete, or in the background, running concurrently while the main session continues. Ctrl+B sends a running foreground agent to the background.</p>
<h3 id="practitioner-experience">Practitioner Experience</h3>
<p>The primary value of custom agents is context isolation. Sub-agents keep investigative work, verbose tool output, and exploratory reasoning out of the main context window, preserving it for higher-level coordination.</p>
<p>houseworth built specialized sub-agents (house-research, house-git, house-bash) and reported achieving &ldquo;90-95% token reduction on heavy operations&rdquo; by returning condensed summaries instead of raw output. adastra22 uses specialized agents (rust-engineer, test-completeness-checker, code-smell-checker) with explicit delegation instructions in the main CLAUDE.md.</p>
<p>Not everyone finds elaborate agent definitions necessary. IgorPartola found that simple role prompts work nearly as well as detailed configurations, suggesting diminishing returns on agent specification complexity. necatiozmen maintains the awesome-claude-code-subagents repository with 100+ production-ready agent definitions for common tasks.</p>
<h2 id="plugin-ecosystem">Plugin Ecosystem</h2>
<p>Plugins are shareable packages that bundle slash commands, agents, MCP servers, hooks, and LSP servers into installable units. They represent Claude Code&rsquo;s module system &ndash; a way to distribute and compose capabilities across projects and teams.</p>
<h3 id="structure">Structure</h3>
<p>A plugin lives in a <code>.claude-plugin/</code> directory with a <code>plugin.json</code> manifest file that declares the plugin&rsquo;s contents:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>commands/</code> &ndash; slash commands (invoked with <code>/plugin-name:command</code>)</li>
<li><code>agents/</code> &ndash; custom agent definitions</li>
<li><code>skills/</code> &ndash; reusable skill templates</li>
<li><code>hooks/hooks.json</code> &ndash; lifecycle hooks</li>
<li><code>.mcp.json</code> &ndash; MCP server configurations</li>
<li><code>.lsp.json</code> &ndash; Language Server Protocol integrations</li>
</ul>
<p>The namespace system (<code>plugin-name:skill-name</code>) prevents conflicts between plugins that might define identically-named components.</p>
<h3 id="installation-scopes">Installation Scopes</h3>
<p>Plugins can be installed at four levels:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>User</strong> &ndash; available in all projects (<code>~/.claude/plugins/</code>)</li>
<li><strong>Project</strong> &ndash; shared via <code>.claude/settings.json</code> (team-wide)</li>
<li><strong>Local</strong> &ndash; personal per-repo installation</li>
<li><strong>Managed</strong> &ndash; admin-controlled enterprise deployment</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>/plugin</code> command provides discovery with Discover, Installed, Marketplaces, and Errors tabs for managing the plugin lifecycle.</p>
<h3 id="ecosystem-scale">Ecosystem Scale</h3>
<p>The plugin ecosystem has grown rapidly. The official Anthropic marketplace (anthropics/claude-plugins-official, 6.9k GitHub stars) provides LSP plugins for 11 languages and external integrations with GitHub, Linear, Figma, Slack, and Sentry, among others. A community registry at claude-plugins.dev offers CLI installation (<code>npx claude-plugins install &lt;id&gt;</code>) and indexes plugins across Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, and other tools.</p>
<p>As of early 2026, the ecosystem encompasses 43+ marketplaces with 834+ documented plugins. Notable categories beyond LSP include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Memory</strong> &ndash; claude-mem, supermemory (discussed in the Memory System section)</li>
<li><strong>Workflow automation</strong> &ndash; commit-commands, ralph-loop</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong> &ndash; security-guidance plugins for vulnerability scanning</li>
<li><strong>Testing</strong> &ndash; Playwright integration for browser testing</li>
<li><strong>Design</strong> &ndash; frontend-design, figma-mcp for design-to-code workflows</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="practitioner-reception">Practitioner Reception</h3>
<p>Reception is mixed. jmathai credits Claude Code&rsquo;s plugin system for enabling a tool that would otherwise &ldquo;only exist in my imagination.&rdquo; The low barrier to creating and sharing plugins has produced a rapid proliferation of community contributions.</p>
<p>Critics raise legitimate concerns. arianvanp argues the system lacks lock files and dependency management, creating risks for reproducible environments. JoshGlazebrook reports configuration fatigue from the expanding surface area of &ldquo;agents, sub agents, skills, claude.md, agents.md, rules, hooks.&rdquo; And anonzzzies argues that vanilla Claude Code with basic MCP consistently outperforms heavily customized setups, suggesting the ecosystem may be solving problems that simpler approaches handle adequately.</p>
<h2 id="practical-tips">Practical Tips</h2>
<p>Based on practitioner reports across the sources analyzed:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Invest in CLAUDE.md early.</strong> The single highest-leverage action for Claude Code users. Document build commands, architecture rules, and known mistakes. Keep it under 1,000 tokens (bcherny) and review weekly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Start with notification hooks.</strong> The easiest entry point to the hooks system. Get alerts when Claude stops or needs input, then graduate to guard rails and auto-lint hooks as you identify failure patterns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Use extended thinking for planning, standard mode for implementation.</strong> This is manual multi-model routing within a single tool and can improve both quality and cost efficiency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Run <code>claude update</code> regularly.</strong> Harness bugs are real and get fixed quickly. Staying on the latest version avoids known regressions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Start with single-agent workflows.</strong> Agent teams are powerful but expensive and harder to review. Master single-agent task decomposition before adding multi-agent complexity. When you do use teams, ensure file-disjoint task assignment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Build custom agents for recurring tasks.</strong> If you run the same investigation or validation pattern repeatedly, wrap it in a custom agent. The context isolation alone saves significant tokens on heavy operations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Set up LSP plugins for your primary language.</strong> The combination of deterministic code intelligence and probabilistic reasoning produces better results than either alone. Check claude-plugins.dev for available integrations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Resist over-customization.</strong> The plugin and configuration surface area is large. Start with vanilla Claude Code plus CLAUDE.md and add complexity only when you hit a concrete pain point. Several practitioners report that simpler setups outperform heavily customized ones.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Monitor your own quality metrics.</strong> Do not rely solely on vendor claims. Track success rates on your actual tasks over time, even if informally.</p>
</li>
</ol>
